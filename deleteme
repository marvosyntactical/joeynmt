### 02.04.20 Dialogue history to source:

add the entire dialogue history to source
problems:
* makes batches unwieldy one batch is one convo, with the batch size being equal to the last utterance (with src==entire history) and examples mostly pad

-> added dialogue history to src; 
-> utterances separated by \<dot\> token

Finished on 02.04.
