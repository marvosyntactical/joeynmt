# Reimplementation of [Key-Value Retrieval Networks for Task-Oriented Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05414.pdf)

### ```TODO```

1. Investigate datasets

Is the entire model trained on just these datasets? e.g. kvr has 3k*~5 <= 15k pairs, which also overlap

2. Look at [JoeyNMT nonworking implementation](https://gitlab.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/zoll/swp-joeynmt/)
3. Look at [Keras Implementation](https://github.com/sunnysai12345/KVMemnn)
