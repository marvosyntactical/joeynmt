it &apos;s that pyramid .
in mother &apos;s milk .
it had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa .
often what jams us up is sewage .
what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
stephen palumbi : following the mercury trail
i really thought they were so beneath me .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator , because we couldn &apos;t manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
bj : and mikey also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mikey brett , craig , leo , zem joaquin and basil and me .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions , for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
they &apos;re betting a visible competition , a prize , can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and thereby speed the solution .
that &apos;s because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them .
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of &quot; democratization of intimacy . &quot;
and so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
but it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital .
and if you think , it &apos;s permeated our whole culture , even our cities .
maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
it &apos;s another one of those categories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
however , neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
brenda palms-farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison .
and by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the endangered hillbillies . &quot;
one problem : waste handling and unemployment .
and we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base .
he grew up in the segregated south , escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
but i did in fact get married in it .
when i was perhaps six years old , i went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother .
i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville , tennessee where people complained about that slurry southern signing .
and i call them horizontal identities , because the peer group is the horizontal experience .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college nearby -- and she said , &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
and i said , &quot; do you regret it ?
this is what we hear when you pray for a cure -- that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
i decided to have children while i was working on this project .
because what i was encountering was an idea of illness .
and he was a clever man . he sort of said , &quot; well , that &apos;s ok , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math sats . &quot;
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re stacked up .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what spirited this , plus the influence of joe and others . we started one laptop per child .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
you don &apos;t call verizon or sprint . you build your own network .
and it was 45 degrees c. i mean , this was not what you &apos;d call a cool experience . and former countries -- i say former , because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press release .
get your friends to give one , get one .
a couple of years ago , i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
but what we call it is r &amp; amp ; d-i-y , or research and develop it yourself .
britta riley : a garden in my apartment
and as you can see , for most of recent history , except for a brief period , we have consistently spent more than we take in . thus the national debt .
but let me explain what i &apos;m thinking .
so basically republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don &apos;t want to be taxed .
they still are an awfully arrogant group of people , i will assure you , but they &apos;re now arrogant about their impartiality , and they , too , see a tremendous range of potential outcomes .
each of those times , we were on the verge of complete collapse .
and from that point on , from my age at the time , i began to think of things in a different way .
and this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
and when i looked at it first , i thought , no , there &apos;s no beauty in that .
i watch faces .
it &apos;s mediated by information before the comprehension .
this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
massimo tamburini .
this is a beautiful water bottle -- some of you know of it -- done by ross lovegrove , the designer .
tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? yes you did .
the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out ?
now let &apos;s move on ; that &apos;s not the end of the story , that &apos;s the very , very beginning .
you know the kind of thing a commencement address is , and graduation ceremonies , those lyrical claims that education , the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .
but anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
we associate repetition with boredom .
but if you &apos;re a zen buddhist in the middle of september , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi , where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of .
so in orthodox jewish communities , every friday you go to a mikveh .
and that &apos;s what art is .
now think about religions , think about organized religions .
if you &apos;re involved in anything that &apos;s communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
how many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
what i &apos;ve tried to lay out is a framework and i &apos;m hoping that people can just fill it in .
so if you look at this pie chart , 96 percent of the universe , at this point in our exploration of it , is unknown or not well understood .
and what the russians are doing is they &apos;re building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light .
but nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
because it &apos;s so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there .
so the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side , and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there &apos;s a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute , and then the parachute is then connected to the payload .
one is what &apos;s on the boston public library .
then the question is , what do you get ?
this is just before he got kicked out by the parks services , for competing with the bookstore there .
and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it , and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good .
but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages , and the volume isn &apos;t there .
and we &apos;re starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
were they ? let &apos;s look at the palestinian television and find out .
so we &apos;re hedging our bets here .
you &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
so the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift .
a group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta -- a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together .
when you look at the mycelium , they &apos;re highly branched .
prototaxites , laying down , was about three feet tall .
these are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together .
this is my wife dusty , with a mushroom called fomitopsis officinalis -- agarikon .
so then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against h5n1 , and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index .
it covers over 200,000 species .
so , we build the carbon banks on the planet , renew the soils .
well , you have to get a little more specific than that if you &apos;re going to build one .
the day i walked into biosphere 2 , i was , for the first time , breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world , except seven other people .
i mean we were dragging ourselves around the biosphere .
so at the end of the two years when we came out , we were elated , because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite &quot; uhh , &quot; when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that &apos;s a very bad failure .
in biosphere 2 i totally understood that i had a huge impact on my biosphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very viscerally , very literally .
i was there because i was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program , under the u.n .
it &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
it also connects us in time .
doctors and medicine made no difference at all .
and we &apos;re trying to deploy this capability , town by town , to every person alive -- in our own country , let alone around the world .
and what that means is there &apos;s hope .
no one had asked this question in his community before .
an aviation checklist , like this one for a single-engine plane , isn &apos;t a recipe for how to fly a plane , it &apos;s a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they &apos;re not checked .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
in some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called israeli acute paralysis virus .
now , there &apos;s another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers , the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone .
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . and it &apos;s a great experience , and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that &apos;s quite essential american experience .
thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950 .
and i think if we reconnect to nature , we &apos;ll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems .
but you can also have this great community of city or building-top beekeepers , these beekeepers that live -- this is in paris where these beekeepers live .
but it can also sound like this .
so what happened now is i &apos;m standing here in rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and i &apos;m talking about whistling .
oh , hah .
plants are not living creatures -- this is the point .
and this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons .
this is interesting because this sleeping machinery , it &apos;s perfectly conserved .
now , this is a root apex growing against a slope .
we have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals , insectoid , so on .
she &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do .
this is the best buy in new york city .
but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop .
but i think it &apos;s also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
look at this magnificent beast and ask the question -- who designed it ?
and you might say it &apos;s about the reverse engineering of religions .
it &apos;s like a coin flip ; it doesn &apos;t count really .
this picture , which i pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .
now , that is not intelligent design -- not from francis crick .
yesterday , in biological terms .
martians would be amazed by this .
those are from &quot; the purpose driven life . &quot;
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
&quot; if there was no god we would all be accidents , the result of astronomical random chance in the universe .
now , rick warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way .
it &apos;s a very clever adaptation of religions .
i wish this meme would go extinct .
he &apos;s saying , &quot; here &apos;s your solution . thanks very much . next . &quot;
and now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed .
it &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
protect your ears ? yes , absolutely .
and , like , within minutes , this is very easy for adults and teens to do .
i don &apos;t care that pencils are supposed to be for writing .
and every time the hula hoop would smush against her body , it would connect two little pieces of copper tape , and it would make a sound , and the next sound , and it would loop the same sounds over and over again .
we should all be participating in changing the way the world works together .
and a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came , and we &apos;re really excited about that .
and yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
what einstein did not realize was that , if you took our sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe .
so we move this earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it &apos;s perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole .
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .
it &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
these two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
it &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
and just recently , we &apos;ve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities .
and at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting , in the way the women of iran , historically , seemed to embody the political transformation .
this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized -- in the way we looked , in the way we played music , in the way we had intellectual life .
and once again , they proved themselves .
that bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself .
compassion is not defined in one form .
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
you learn swimming by swimming .
swami dayananda saraswati unravels the parallel paths of personal development and attaining true compassion . he walks us through each step of self-realization , from helpless infancy to the fearless act of caring for others .
at first , it &apos;s very unintuitive , but when you actually think about it from their point of view , it makes a ton of sense .
then we went on to the dreaded fractions . again , he got it .
so once the khan academy -- i quit my job and we turned into a real organization -- we &apos;re a not-for-profit -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ?
stay on that bicycle . fall off that bicycle .
these kids aren &apos;t using textbooks , they &apos;re not getting one-size-fits-all lectures .
and then you can see , eventually , they were able to get 10 in a row .
but this is all one system .
sk : it &apos;s two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes .
and yeah , you can start becoming a mentor , a tutor , really immediately .
and she said , &quot; people in eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs .
she had no control over them .
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
on one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
now , i don &apos;t watch sesame street , but she made a point of saying , &quot; why kermit ? &quot; she said , &quot; kermit the frog means nothing to me .
and you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
&quot; face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
oliver sacks : what hallucination reveals about our minds
i spend most of my time working in the dark ; i &apos;m used to that .
they use it for finding food , for attracting mates , for defending against predators .
it &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
and i think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
he keeps coming back .
and i start with galileo who used the world &apos;s first telescope to look at the moon .
but i want to talk about a different aspect of dna science , and that is the physical nature of dna .
we &apos;re pulling out , we &apos;re zooming out , out through a nuclear pore , which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the dna called the nucleus .
but what we &apos;re going to focus on is this red region -- i &apos;ve labeled it red here -- and it &apos;s the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes .
discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science .
it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world , and it &apos;s never going to be quenched .
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
when the subject is still very thinly populated , you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority .
e.o. wilson : advice to young scientists
and then another communication technology enabled new media : the printing press came along , and within decades , millions of people became literate .
here &apos;s how the game is played : there are two players ; they &apos;ve never played the game before , they will not play the game again , they don &apos;t know each other , and they are , in fact , in separate rooms .
and most recently , neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .
in el salvador , both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner &apos;s dilemma strategy .
so , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in haiti , before and after pictures from the sky .
all right , guys , are you there ?
and that &apos;s curtis wong , worldwide telescope .
it suggests that we care about reaching the end , a peak .
and when they finished , we asked them , &quot; do you want to build another one ? &quot; for $ 2.40 , $ 2.10 , and so on , until at some point people said , &quot; no more . it &apos;s not worth it for me . &quot;
and by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
i can &apos;t tell you who they were , but they were a big company in seattle .
that was the task .
it turns out it was almost like the shredder .
what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
or do you think , &quot; i love this origami , and everybody else will love it as well ? &quot;
imagine if you did not have your kids , and one day you went to the park and you met some kids , and they were just like your kids .
i think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort , attention , caring , how connected they feel to it , are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on , all of a sudden marx has more things to say to us .
the reason that they gave about american bombing wasn &apos;t all that far off .
but she &apos;d given the boys girls &apos; names , and the girls boys &apos; names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
to compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context .
this was our sign -- it &apos;s hand-painted , and we had 45 all over kabul .
one hazara said to his pashtun counselor , &quot; if we were to have met some years ago , then we would have killed each other .
transport , we don &apos;t need oil anymore . &quot;
so , that &apos;s the u.k. , and the population density of the u.k .
so , let &apos;s now say why this is relevant . why is it relevant ?
they all have a small power per unit area , and we have to live with that fact .
that &apos;s the average european car .
here &apos;s a graph i made .
from the very first rehearsal , i saw the bright future ahead .
he started as a boy member of the children &apos;s orchestra in his hometown , barquisimeto .
the spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society .
and they &apos;re not embarrassed by a meds caddy that &apos;s ugly , that sits on their kitchen table and says , &quot; i &apos;m old . i &apos;m frail . &quot;
wow , what a great day that will be once we &apos;re allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
it &apos;s like the lights are on , but nobody &apos;s home on this demographic y2k + 10 problem . right ?
with my own healthcare problems , i &apos;ve taken drug therapies , i &apos;ve traveled to this hospital and others , many , many times .
that &apos;s what we need to do for our personal health model .
and most often we can do two interventions , fix the meds mix .
no matter who pays for it , we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways .
today , we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses .
cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code .
malware is very boring otherwise .
we really should clean that up .
a little more searching , and here &apos;s our cybercriminal .
okay ? so you can see a list of wireless networks .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a staggering rate , and that 250,000 pieces of malware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
&quot; you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velociraptor : the velociraptor is cool . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agreed .
and quite frankly , i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece .
that &apos;s based on diet intake surveys , it &apos;s based on levels of obesity , it &apos;s based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people &apos;s mouths .
that &apos;s a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture , whether it &apos;s a lack of infrastructure , refrigeration , pasteurization , grain stores , even basic fruit crates , which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields .
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications , tomatoes in tenerife , oranges in florida , bananas in ecuador , where i visited last year , all being discarded . this is one day &apos;s waste from one banana plantation in ecuador .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it .
this is from their actual book .
yeah , i &apos;m at the depressio , and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map , and click the button and there &apos;s my directions .
anyone can suggest changing a name .
there are no jovians .
the reality , now here is something important .
that &apos;s not a good picture .
once again , that &apos;s sierra leone .
i know that scares a lot of you , but that was my purpose entirely .
there is so many intricate relationships that i &apos;m not going to go there now , because you would say , &quot; hey , go back to the fluctus part . &quot;
i found other pairs all have symmetry , even though , unlike the master one , their symmetry is split .
in a presentation that can only be described as epic , comedian charles fleischer delivers a hysterical send-up of a time-honored theme : the map . geometry , numbers , charts and stamp art also factor in , as he weaves together a unique theory of everything called &quot; moleeds . &quot;
my rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
and so there &apos;s a lot of -- i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve read a lot in papers , about worries about cyber attacks and defenses against those .
nobody really knows what the internet is right now because it &apos;s different than it was an hour ago .
however , this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons .
just 3 years ago , both the u.s. and france were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace , strictly to defend their it systems .
just last week , in a new york times article dated january 26 , 2010 , it was revealed for the first time that officials at the national security agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the u.s. was about to be cyberattacked .
there &apos;s been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean , mostly negative .
or this fangtooth . the particles in the water make it look like it &apos;s floating in outer space .
it can change its body into a big , intimidating fish in a matter of seconds .
so with characters , you can make stories .
and a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean , which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it , especially if they can &apos;t stand each other , like these two .
it becomes a near-death experience for sherman .
and they turn up the lights .
in two four-month seasons i saw not a dozen people .
well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
there is something called the square of a number , which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself .
anyone i point to , call out a three-digit number .
now you can all take your time on this ; i will not beat you to the answer on this one , but i will try to get the answer right .
seven , and yours ? seven .
if you think you know your birth day , raise your hand .
audience : may . may what ?
it was . and it was cloudy .
i &apos;ll do 57,000 squared , plus 683 squared , plus 57,000 times 683 times two .
i hope you enjoyed mathemagics . thank you .
so don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
right away , i hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
soon after that , i found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
i was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
i was all set to do it and i was thinking , &quot; aw man , &quot; i was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
to measure the wavelength , all i need to do is measure the distance from here -- one full wave -- over to here .
this cop comes after me with a rifle .
i &apos;m asking myself , &quot; why am i here ? &quot;
first up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto.com .
look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10 .
at the bottom of this , it says , &quot; it &apos;s deeper than gender .
and it &apos;s that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .
it doesn &apos;t have a particular purpose , and that &apos;s what &apos;s great about play .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have a playful-looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
the basis of human trust is established through play signals .
summers were hard , hard work , in the heat of tennessee summers .
the wearable meeting .
so people know that it &apos;s there .
so when you &apos;re looking at this thing in the dining room , you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos , and it &apos;s not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert , and it &apos;s just kind of like a mind-ripper .
hc : so if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things , we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon , and it makes it go from sweet to savory .
and here &apos;s how news shapes what americans see .
and if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong .
so i write software . and that &apos;s how i do it .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .
how could it respond , in a way , to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we &apos;re looking at it ?
and i &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
hollywood does this all the time , of course .
one of the things i want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact .
nathan wolfe : this species , yeah . and there &apos;s many many more pathogens that are present in these animals .
so , in 1998 , along with my mentors don burke and colonel mpoudi-ngole , we went to actually start this work in central africa , to work with hunters in this part of the world .
this was our laboratory before .
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us .
it is by sharing these moments as they &apos;re happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch , despite distance , and in real time .
summize built a twitter search engine .
worst talk ever ! &quot;
there weren &apos;t many of them available , and they weren &apos;t quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
years later , i thought about this when i left nigeria to go to university in the united states .
but what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling african stories in the west : a tradition of sub-saharan africa as a place of negatives , of difference , of darkness , of people who , in the words of the wonderful poet rudyard kipling , are &quot; half devil , half child . &quot;
the palestinian poet mourid barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people , the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with , &quot; secondly . &quot;
but there are other stories that are not about catastrophe , and it is very important , it is just as important , to talk about them .
what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider , who has just started her own business selling hair extensions ?
and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing , we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do .
they make mistakes every single day -- mistakes born out of carelessness .
encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts , which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true .
that &apos;s a lot of people .
he &apos;ll sign his name on every line , he &apos;ll check all the boxes , he &apos;ll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers .
i need a heart so pure that if it &apos;s stripped bare by dementia , it will survive .
how do you do it from the power of the consumer up ?
we looked at the question , what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car .
in europe where taxes are in place , that &apos;s the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
and actually true to form , renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume -- mass volume being the first year , 100 thousand cars .
the second one was the san francisco bay area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors .
in other words at some point when we &apos;ve recovered we go up to the peak .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
these are perfect matches to one another .
and people said , &quot; well we need to take time to do it .
don &apos;t be fooled . there &apos;s nothing new about id .
the standard creationist argument -- there is only one ; they all reduce to this one -- takes off from a statistical improbability .
in my view , not only is science corrosive to religion ; religion is corrosive to science .
incidentally , i &apos;m not usually very proud of being british , but you can &apos;t help making the comparison .
that is , the higher one &apos;s intelligence or educational level , the less one is likely to be religious . &quot;
when a critical mass has been attained , there &apos;s an abrupt acceleration in recruitment .
the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .
if you &apos;re one of them , and of course many of you may not be , but if you are one of them , i &apos;m asking you to stop being polite , come out and say so , and if you happen to be rich , give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference .
all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period , there &apos;s another supercomputer running in the world -- seti @ home .
so , all of that is in the creation of content , of relevance , basic human expression .
you have to hire them to spend a lot of time .
because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes , or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model , and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see .
and therefore , when you hear about the corrupt africa -- corruption all the time -- i want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries , and that some successes are emerging .
in fact , if you &apos;re not in nigeria , you &apos;re not in africa .
but there &apos;s a huge market out there , and people don &apos;t know about it , or they don &apos;t want to know .
we have opportunities in housing and real estate .
and , you know , you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent , it looks like the entire continent is affected .
however , many of these are starved for capital to expand , because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary . nobody thinks in terms of a market .
are we safer today ?
so that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
in addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
now , what does this mean ?
these are largely hidden from the immune system .
so , here &apos;s an alarming thought .
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
that &apos;s what europe is doing , so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available , but , going back to what michael specter said , the anti-vaccine crowd didn &apos;t really want that to happen .
they are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
that &apos;s the cheetah generation , and africa &apos;s salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs .
there are people who think that we should pour more money , more aid into this bowl which leaks .
i let that pass .
the modern sector is the abode of the elites .
without the council the chief can &apos;t pass any law , and if the chief doesn &apos;t govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .
kano , salaga -- they were all there .
now , it is not just this informal sector .
i like hearing what they &apos;re thinking about ; i like seeing what they link to ; i like learning a thing or two .
there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization .
but that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
thank you so much , chris . and it &apos;s truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice . i &apos;m extremely grateful .
i told it pretty much the same way i &apos;ve just shared it with you : tipper and i were driving ourselves , shoney &apos;s , low-cost family restaurant chain , what the man said -- they laughed .
but they are also very effective in deflecting our path .
invest sustainably . majora mentioned this .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
and already , commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do with all that stuff .
but as many people have said , there &apos;s a large attempt to suppress what &apos;s going on .
their numbers have never recovered .
but they concentrate in the gulf and then fan out all across the arctic .
also , for all the shoreline that has booms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline -- all of the shoreline that has booms , there &apos;s adjacent shoreline that doesn &apos;t have any booms .
that &apos;s certainly one of the things we need to do .
ever since we lived in caves , every time we wanted any energy , we lit something on fire , and that is still what we &apos;re doing .
it doesn &apos;t produce more energy out than i put in , but it still does some pretty cool stuff .
i &apos;ve got brown eyes ; you might have blue or gray .
and in the 1970s and &apos; 80s , a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons .
and we &apos;re zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times to obtain the resolution , so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time .
you guys are laughing , but you know , this book changed my life .
and indeed , these days i harbor new hopes .
what &apos;s in this picture ?
but it won &apos;t be easy , because they &apos;re not going to look like this .
i don &apos;t know -- i prefer to test their beliefs , scientifically .
we spent a long time thinking about why this is , and it &apos;s just recently that we realized : it &apos;s when we see something unexpected , it changes our understanding of the way things work .
ks : now , we showed the concept to a few people before this , and they asked us , when &apos;s it coming out ?
ks : now , the interesting thing about this is , you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .
it &apos;s perfectly clear , it &apos;s odorless , it &apos;s colorless .
taking it a little further , if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet , and then you could embed it in a cloth : so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table , so that way on a windy day it wouldn &apos;t blow away .
his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn , how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene ?
i mean , it &apos;s crucified .
what &apos;s natural about foie gras ?
he doesn &apos;t look like a guy who &apos;s paying off french judges for his foie gras .
so i hushed my voice .
there &apos;s figs and everything else there for the taking .
he let it go to seed , he took the seeds , he planted it on his 30 acres , all around .
&#91; clapping &#93; and the wild geese are calling down .
it was incredible .
we went back out for the final tour of the farm , and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .
insult to history .
that &apos;s the history of foie gras .
listening as janine benyus , one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says , &quot; listening to nature &apos;s operating instructions . &quot;
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air .
our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles .
don &apos;t worry about dropping it , it &apos;s tougher than titanium .
the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the empire state building -- remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light , but reflect heat .
and germany now has more solar workers than america has steel workers .
in america , our aging , dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 .
now if you like any of those outcomes , you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important .
his was a lonely struggle , because bihar was also india &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
this is the second shift : open aid .
but , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
and definitively , i don &apos;t know why i am here , but -- you know the nightmare you can have , like you are an impostor , you arrive at the opera , and they push you , &quot; you must sing ! &quot;
but to come back , where i am at the animal species , there is things to see .
that is our poetry . that is our beautiful story .
the more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
that &apos;s why i say that . i say that , because , i repeat , nothing exist if it &apos;s not in the good reason , the reason of our beautiful dream , of this civilization .
foreign policy , you can figure that out by watching , i don &apos;t know , rachel maddow or somebody , but — — i want to talk about young people and structure , young people and structure .
do you understand ? &quot;
i &apos;m telling you you didn &apos;t shave . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to read to you . &quot;
and then i went into geology , &quot; rocks for jocks . &quot; this is easy .
they had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the south bronx , but they had more than just expectations for us .
it &apos;s a country of such contrasts , but it &apos;s a nation of nations .
so we are still that magnificent country , but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world , and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind .
it asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones .
at frog , the company i work for , we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees , helping them get to know each other fast .
everything was going wrong .
a lot of us , we &apos;re not really happy when we see a video of an egyptian man who &apos;s eating the trash while others are stealing billions of egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country .
but of course , they don &apos;t listen .
and when i saw the street on the 25th , i went back and said , &quot; egypt before the 25th is never going to be egypt after the 25th .
i said that , &quot; we are going to win .
what this mother -- and the 800 people who speak koro in the world -- understands &#91; is &#93; that , to preserve this language , they need to speak it to the babies .
so at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent .
but the taiwanese babies are getting better , not the american babies .
so this is little emma .
what i am trying to do is i &apos;m trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer &apos;s heart but also to the viewer &apos;s brain .
and it &apos;s got tiny little particles of metal in it , which makes it magnetic .
so when i open the bottle , the alcohol molecules would spread in the air , and that &apos;s because alcohol is a very volatile substance .
swiss artist and photographer fabian oefner is on a mission to make eye-catching art from everyday science . in this charming talk , he shows off some recent psychedelic images , including photographs of crystals as they interact with soundwaves . and , in a live demo , he shows what really happens when you mix paint with magnetic liquid--or when you set fire to whiskey .
every year or so , i have the privilege of taking clinicians into the himalayas and the tibetan plateau .
that component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
hey , we live in a very noxious world .
you have to come into the world like asanga did , who was looking to realize maitreya buddha after 12 years sitting in the cave .
now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
now look at those numbers .
and if you divide the larger number by the smaller number , then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618 , known to many people as the golden ratio , a number which has fascinated mathematicians , scientists and artists for centuries .
where i &apos;ve had some problems is some of the arab countries , because i guess some of the arab countries aren &apos;t getting along with iran either .
&quot; gimme all your money , or i &apos;ll blow myself up . &quot;
i just did a seven-country solo tour .
and i &apos;ve taken my two year-old son to playgrounds all over the united states .
a founding member of the axis of evil comedy tour , standup comic maz jobrani riffs on the challenges and conflicts of being iranian-american -- &quot; like , part of me thinks i should have a nuclear program ; the other part thinks i can &apos;t be trusted ... &quot;
you were great .
bad experiences are quickly forgotten .
she was my childhood friend .
once , for example , i was interviewing this part-timer from the red brigades .
so , state sponsor of terrorism , feature of the cold war .
it has happened before in history .
this is how close we are with this world .
i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
i thought there were them and there were us , and i was not one of them .
oars are your only means of propulsion .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
unfortunately , ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line .
so , to make the point , these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash , 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons .
he expects that within the next 50 years , the 100,000 people that live there will have to relocate to new zealand or australia .
other people will see if you &apos;re in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag .
this song is one of thomas &apos; favorites , called &quot; what you do with what you &apos;ve got . &quot;
at the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
manifest destiny .
a brand-new way to put buildings together , something called mass customization . no , it is not an oxymoron .
these are the pieces , and here &apos;s a little of that blown up .
&quot; when it &apos;s all said and done , it &apos;s got to look like seaweed , &quot; said the owner .
this is about a place in london called kiteflyer &apos;s hill where i used to go and spend hours going &quot; when is he coming back ? when is he coming back ? &quot;
when i was a kid , i wanted to shave .
my finishing move was going to be the trash compactor .
one day , before i realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees , i fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body .
he was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree , adopted , not because his parents opted for a different destiny .
we are graduating members from the class of we made it , not the faded echoes of voices crying out , &quot; names will never hurt me . &quot;
it &apos;s believable , it &apos;s tactile .
the world &apos;s largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world , canada &apos;s boreal forest .
if i stand beside that truck , my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap .
oil sands -- or rather i should say tar sands -- &quot; oil sands &quot; is a p.r.-created term so that the oil companies wouldn &apos;t be trying to promote something that sounds like a sticky tar-like substance that &apos;s the world &apos;s dirtiest oil .
the boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change .
when one of these tar sands tankers , carrying the dirtiest oil , 10 times as much as the exxon valdez , eventually hits a rock and goes down , we &apos;re going to have one of the worst ecological disasters this planet has ever seen .
right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .
he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect , whether on the roof of a temple in singapore , or in his increasingly ambitious installation work , here with 192 functioning sewing machines , fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations .
ravin agrawal : 10 young indian artists to watch
and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government .
i &apos;ll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus-7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if i &apos;m successful in my mission .
for many people , this means , i wish i &apos;d spent more time with my family , with my kids when they were growing up .
my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , i had to rest it .
that lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far .
i understand myself better . i know who i really am now .
well done , everyone . now that is worth plus-one physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster .
okay , one more . baby elephant .
yeah ! awesome .
just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the tallest models are about two or three feet high .
so i said yes to this proposition .
and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet . it happens to be a fact .
it &apos;s a definition really of euclidean space .
this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because , like you , they &apos;re sitting there feeling bamboozled .
now , i said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible .
we live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation -- algebraic representations , equations , codes .
i mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a freudian view , and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but i &apos;ll just talk about guys .
but from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
one of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
and this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , ok ?
and he started giggling , he says , &quot; i can see my phantom . &quot;
i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
this has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
and , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
all of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
well , i don &apos;t know . there were tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire .
canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
ss : so kanzi is very interested in fire .
panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors .
ss : but since i &apos;m advised not to do what i normally do , i haven &apos;t told you that these apes have language .
the bonobo &apos;s abilities have stunned scientists around the world .
now we can chase them again . go get them .
that &apos;s mars from the european mars express , and at new year .
well , we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the big bang , but we still don &apos;t know what banged and why it banged .
and the most complex things are ourselves , midway between atoms and stars .
and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence .
on that schematic picture , a sort of time-lapse picture , we &apos;re halfway .
within just 50 years -- that &apos;s one hundredth of one millionth of the earth &apos;s age -- the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise , and ominously fast .
so cnn , a little while ago , wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery .
we asked them how happy they were , and then we gave them an envelope .
and the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn &apos;t matter that much .
but then we see extraordinary differences .
are they positively correlated ? giving money makes you happy .
and one way to think about it is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves , they put it in their pocket , they don &apos;t do anything different than they did before .
sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope .
rabin &apos;s statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two , which in turn was born out of perception of common threats .
so according to indyk , and these are his words , the iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment .
you make it with your enemies . &quot;
so , that &apos;s happening in the u.k. with u.k. government data .
the map of port au-prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be , not as good as the map of california .
and here &apos;s the trick .
as anyone would , as they do this , they develop a sixth sense , a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money .
it blocks the right too , as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible .
so i want you to take hold , to grab the issue you care the most about .
it takes generations to tear that intuition , that dna , out of the soul of a people .
because if you do , then what the hell are you , what are the hell are we doing ?
but just three days later , on a day they called red monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their sputnik rocket as an ibm missile .
but as far as being a performer , i &apos;m also diagnosed bipolar .
john gartner wrote this book called &quot; the hypomanic edge &quot; in which christopher columbus and ted turner and steve jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete .
do you think you could do it ? i would like to see if this audience would -- no , you haven &apos;t practiced , as far as i know -- can you get it together to clap in sync ?
we &apos;re so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony .
as i say , if you &apos;re in a swarm , your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .
then on , and then off -- a 30th of a second , there .
in a laser , what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent -- many different colors and different frequencies , sort of like the way you clapped initially -- but if you were a laser , it would be rhythmic applause .
i &apos;m going to put them on a movable platform , which is the &quot; guide to graduate study at cornell . &quot; okay ? so here it is .
interviewer : just sideways . about how much was it moving , do you think ?
it was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move , that engineers knew nothing about .
you have to be careful where you put your feet down , don &apos;t you , because if you get it wrong , it just throws you off your feet .
and he also understood that that foundation was crumbling , literally crumbling .
they gave them their name .
why ? as a raw material , as a trait we can use in the future .
we have two rolls of the dice to get this right .
this is more than just an artist &apos;s dream , it &apos;s now a reality .
i think it &apos;s interesting in that this facility , i think , is almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries , literally , every country in the world -- because we have seeds from every country in the world -- all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that &apos;s both long term , sustainable and positive .
cary fowler : one seed at a time , protecting the future of food
you should care about your posture -- this is not right .
anybody feels threatened , anybody really need it ?
there were probably at least 30,000 different things tried , and when they crash and kill the pilot , don &apos;t try that again .
the most impressive spaceship ever , i believe , was a grumman lunar lander . it was a -- you know , it landed on the moon , take off of the moon , didn &apos;t need any maintenance guys -- that &apos;s kind of cool .
well , first of all , what &apos;s going to happen next ?
and in it also brings up another point , right here .
you can fly with russian hardware . this is available because a russian space program is starving , and it &apos;s nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats .
why is this happening ?
now , i think , in fact , we &apos;re at a turning point in human history , where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the industrial age around a new set of principles .
your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night .
and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world .
but in the tunisian revolution , the new media didn &apos;t cause the revolution ; it was caused by injustice .
it was agrarian , and the means of production and political system was called feudalism , and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the nobility .
now , this thing has a function .
the revolution is called angiogenesis , and it &apos;s based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels .
now i &apos;m going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer , every type of cancer .
and we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal , healthy vessels we see in other places of the body : they &apos;re abnormal ; they &apos;re very poorly constructed ; and , because of that , they &apos;re highly vulnerable to treatments that target them .
now , obviously , antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers .
so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so this approach that we &apos;re taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity .
william li presents a new way to think about treating cancer and other diseases : anti-angiogenesis , preventing the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor . the crucial first step : eating cancer-fighting foods that cut off the supply lines and beat cancer at its own game .
i read martin gardner &apos;s columns in scientific american .
this is called a figure-ground illusion .
and so i think a lot about interaction .
now , this one is a little bit trickier .
there is only one solution . it &apos;s not that hard .
there is also a trend towards games that are good for you .
oh , yeah . there , okay . j-o and -- i guess that &apos;s that part . we got the bow . that bow helps .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
their stories were so horrific , and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered .
i &apos;ve traveled , as i said , to many , many countries , and i &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &apos;s horrific to think what we do to girls in the world .
there is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tattooed on the right side of her face .
and in that time she saved many girls . and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , &quot; well , if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster . &quot;
agnes took her in , and agnes loved her , and agnes supported her for the year .
and this girl just sat up and went , &quot; i love being a girl .
oh , i know when the coconut &apos;s about to fall .
eve ensler : embrace your inner girl
so what &apos;s the problem ?
remember , the investigating officers &apos; report said the lighting was good .
at this point , i became a little concerned .
the opposing council always fight it and oppose it .
and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing .
and so i finally got to this city , and i &apos;d done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when i got there , i got to the palace of the chief , and my french is not very good ; i said something like , &quot; i am a mathematician and i would like to stand on your roof . &quot;
and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mali just outside of bamako , and i asked him , &quot; how come you &apos;re making fractal fences ? because nobody else is . &quot;
and it turns out it &apos;s a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos .
we &apos;ve found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software .
we have blended families , adopted families , we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house .
one has asperger syndrome . one has adhd .
they do things in small chunks .
so following the agile model , we ask three questions : what worked well in our family this week , what didn &apos;t work well , and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead ?
i &apos;ve taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met .
so time-shift family dinner . that &apos;s adaptability .
every minute above that , we have to do one pushup .
i made popcorn . actually , i burned one , so i made two .
as the author of the study told me , children who have a sense of -- they &apos;re part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence .
in the end , this may be the greatest lesson of all .
and it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
and then when i went through that big , horrible breakup with carl and i couldn &apos;t get off the couch , i listened to your song , &quot; now that i don &apos;t have you , &quot; over and over and over and over again .
and all i &apos;m saying is that i really wish that murray gell-mann would go on oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is , in fact , not a law .
nt : i needed no models , drawings or experiments .
nt : everything i did , i did for mankind , for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich , where products of intellect , science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life .
but this was common .
that &apos;s a little better . that side is better .
on the basis of this result , this is now a procedure that &apos;s done throughout the world , and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery .
anybody interested in that ?
so the message i want to leave you with today is that , indeed , there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states , whether we &apos;re talking about parkinson &apos;s disease , depression , schizophrenia , alzheimer &apos;s .
think about it . if you were an engineer and i told you that you had to build an automobile , but it had to start off to be this big , then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .
and we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down , but they &apos;re also bouncing side to side at the same time .
here &apos;s what some of you did this morning , although you did it outside , not on a treadmill .
robert full : it &apos;ll go on different surfaces -- here &apos;s sand -- although we haven &apos;t perfected the feet yet , but i &apos;ll talk about that later .
do you see how much it &apos;s bending like that ? we can &apos;t figure that out -- that &apos;s an unsolved mystery . we don &apos;t know how it works .
here &apos;s an individual hair with a little split end there .
thank you .
and i said , &quot; are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ? &quot;
two , make your partner a real partner .
the problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows : women systematically underestimate their own abilities .
but that one word made a really big difference .
i &apos;ve become convinced that we &apos;ve made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home .
and she said , &quot; oh no , i &apos;m not married . &quot;
sheryl sandberg : why we have too few women leaders
so i &apos;m going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago .
the people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen -- it &apos;s the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior .
and that doesn &apos;t just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we &apos;re inundated with .
but we have an opportunity .
you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects .
likewise , you can go over your lipids and , again , understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the hdl and the ldl if you so choose .
and so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that .
so i want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information .
and the question i asked myself that afternoon in the garden , working alongside that bumblebee , was : what did i and that bumblebee have in common ?
i &apos;m a dupe . i &apos;m a dupe of the lawns , whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees , who they compete with for sunlight . &quot;
so when you look at the plants , you realize that there are other tools and they &apos;re just as interesting .
and i spent a week as an apprentice on his farm , and i took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that i &apos;ve ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature .
and within four or five weeks , he can do it again .
this is a way to reanimate the world , and that &apos;s what &apos;s so exciting about this perspective .
hopefully for good .
and so that &apos;s what i want to talk about for game dynamics , because construction has just begun , and the more consciously we can think about this , the better we &apos;ll be able to use it for anything that we want .
it &apos;s incredibly powerful , and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops -- fake crops -- or they wilt .
and this is used in games as well .
i would .
and they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective , it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership .
audience : yes .
and pretty much everywhere there is power , there is the internet .
and so i guess the u.s. finally , finally started to like it , too .
i know all of you are thinking , &quot; yet another social network . &quot;
and news , which i just mentioned , was started by a researcher .
so this is a new -- how many of you use the google toolbar ?
but anyway , every year we &apos;ve taken the whole company on a ski trip .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
and i think we &apos;re really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search , and i think that &apos;s a tremendous , tremendous benefit .
but this wasn &apos;t always the way .
i &apos;m a fully paid-up member of that priesthood , and somewhere in here i have my designer glasses .
they do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross-subsidize those who cannot .
they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
so instead of having a bunch of american designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate , we took a sort of more open , collaborative and participative approach .
tim brown says the design profession has a bigger role to play than just creating nifty , fashionable little objects . he calls for a shift to local , collaborative , participatory &quot; design thinking &quot; -- starting with the example of 19th-century design thinker isambard kingdom brunel .
unfortunately , these beliefs are based on assumptions that don &apos;t always hold true in many countries , in many cultures .
one girl named mary said , &quot; you asked my mother ? &quot;
during the very first session , which was run in russia , one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard .
in reality , many choices are between things that are not that much different .
two days later , the doctors gave the mitchells a choice : they could either remove barbara off the life support , in which case she would die within a matter of hours , or they could keep her on life support , in which case she might still die within a matter of days .
we interpret what we see , select the most workable of the multiple choices .
thank you .
so i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory , and i stripped the labels off .
if you &apos;re multiplying the rig , so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you &apos;re using , you can collect a lot more .
so this is happening in the netherlands .
it &apos;s just an intellectual property setup .
you are laying down in a flexible torpedo , sailing at high speed , controlling the shape of the hull with your legs and controlling the sail with your arms .
girl 2 : that would be so stressful .
for 50 years , it &apos;s been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world . and i got to thinking , you know , who else talks that way ?
how &apos;s that ?
about 20 percent of all the nation &apos;s programmers were wrapped up in this thing , and it led to an awful lot of what we have today . it also used vacuum tubes .
every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern , new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues .
here he is talking from the 1960s .
there was lsd leaking out of kesey &apos;s veterans &apos; hospital experiments and other areas around the campus , and there was music literally in the streets .
a few years later , we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of , how do you get the content you want , the way you want it and the easy way ?
though some were incredulous ... man 1 : the phone company !
he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it , and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea .
ph : one of the great things that &apos;s going on here is the globalization of content really is happening .
ph : so , to wrap up , i &apos;d love to throw it back to marshall mcluhan , who , 40 years ago , was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change , and i think that , today , traditional hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before .
how did i get started in this business ?
a terrific use of local materials , but inside you could find some interior compositions .
and this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone , and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that .
i don &apos;t have very many shots of people , because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form .
and it &apos;s a welcoming area , i think , inclusive of diversity , reflective of diversity , and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u.s .
it did mine .
studied painting ; didn &apos;t do very well at that .
i basically engineered it .
she said , &quot; but it &apos;s too high . &quot;
the next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor .
and you need it in a different position when you &apos;re upright , then when you &apos;re reclined .
and dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened . mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world , and these insects have infested over 100 countries , and there &apos;s now 2.5 billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides .
well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population .
if there &apos;s a male mosquito that you release , and if there &apos;s a female around , that male will find the female .
we can produce them , in a space a bit more than this red carpet , i can produce about 20 million a week .
in 2001 i got hit by a train .
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
so , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
anybody got any clues ? ski . right .
that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
listen , you &apos;ll see being dead is dandy .
thank you , ted .
phosphorus is a key component in several molecules , in many of our molecules of life .
it goes into the soil , ending its journey in the lakes , resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus , which leads to the blue algae problem .
but we are indeed heading for a major crisis , and i &apos;d like people to become aware of this problem .
it can go beyond the root &apos;s one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus .
and in some cases , in cuba , mexico and india , the dose can be reduced to 25 percent , and in several other cases , there &apos;s no need to add any phosphorus at all , because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil .
but what was important is , the gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form .
so , in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components , so there might be up to , say , 50,000 pieces of material in this room you &apos;re sitting in right now that all need to get organized .
in terms of construction and manufacturing , this is a kilometer-long housing block that was built in the &apos; 70s in amsterdam .
so , we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped , very similar to that housing project i showed you , and we could recombine those together , so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way .
finally , i &apos;d like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bolivian edge of the amazon , here also in 1975 , and if you look really carefully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of seam , and there &apos;s a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle .
well , the colorado on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a flood , not a drought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
let &apos;s put it that way .
and yet , we don &apos;t talk about it very much .
the green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources .
here &apos;s the dilemma ...
it &apos;s caught here , frozen , shipped down to lagos , smoked , and sold for a tiny increment of profit on the streets of lagos .
1.8 billion people around the world work in the economy that is unregulated and informal .
the name is a misnomer .
and so i just want to leave you there , and say that this economy is a tremendous force for global development and we need to think about it that way .
here you see a patent for an arm in 1912 .
we built our own arm at the rehab institute of chicago where we &apos;ve added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors , or six degrees of freedom .
and we can use electrodes or antennae to pick that up and tell the arm to move .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s intuitive .
and we &apos;re fortunate today to have amanda kitts come and join us .
for 20 years , my goal was to let somebody &#91; be &#93; able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time .
tk : thank you , amanda .
and it now has a hand that can do different grasps .
we &apos;re excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do .
six years ago , at the time of her hiv diagnosis , she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time .
the high prevalence of hiv drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable .
in addition , they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends .
and one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback .
this is a picture of a galapagos penguin that &apos;s on the front of a little zodiac here in the galapagos .
that means that there &apos;s no upwelling , and there &apos;s basically no food .
penguins don &apos;t like oil and they don &apos;t like to swim through oil .
try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins .
so this is turbo .
then i realize that they &apos;re playing king of the box .
now this is important , because border conflicts justify so much of the world &apos;s military-industrial complex .
and only 30 million people are in its eastern areas .
now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years .
the asian free trade zone , almost free trade zone , that &apos;s emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific .
six years after the u.s. invasion of iraq , the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality .
that , i believe , is going to bring peace to this particular conflict .
just take azerbaijan .
what does that tell us ? trade and investment tell us that europe is putting its money where its mouth is .
it has three ongoing civil wars , the genocide in darfur , which you all know about , the civil war in the east of the country , and south sudan .
they thought you just wear out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
and they can be completely fertile -- have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do .
well as you know , genes , which are part of the dna , they &apos;re instructions to make a protein that does something .
and it &apos;s looking like that &apos;s the case .
well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants , a whole lot of genes are switched on in the dna that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues , and repair damage .
you can store the food , use it for energy , grow , etc .
so this is really exciting to me .
there isn &apos;t the technology to do that .
and maybe they &apos;re even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ll never see an ad like that because nike actually wants you to buy their shoes .
look at these 10 movies . what do they have in common ?
how can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don &apos;t count in canada ?
in 2013 , if you &apos;re concerned about a depression diagnosis , you go to your doctor , and what do you get ?
so in this way , by doing this kind of test , we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors , something that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to do right now in humans .
so we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator pietro perona , who &apos;s in the electrical engineering division here at caltech .
so that means that these flies have two abnormalities , or phenotypes , as we geneticists call them , that one finds in adhd : hyperactivity and learning disability .
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood ? that &apos;s awful , right ?
in contrast , the african malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person , and that of course we should have known all along because they &apos;re called mosqui-toes , you see ?
ooh , that was very quick .
have a look . that doesn &apos;t work . okay . sorry about that .
and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living , related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ , like a split liver graft , to a relative or loved one .
i witnessed the technical difficulty .
in may 2006 , something horrible happened to me .
as we speak , the world &apos;s first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the usfda approval .
the teresa carreño youth orchestra contains the best high school musicians from venezuela &apos;s life-changing music program , el sistema . led here by gustavo dudamel , they play shostakovich &apos;s symphony no. 10 , 2nd movement , and arturo márquez &apos; danzón no. 2 .
well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out .
this is an actual study , and let me clarify .
and i &apos;m thinking they &apos;ve done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could .
dr. gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the &quot; dragonball z : android saga . &quot;
so in this situation too , to decode the information contained in patterns like this , watching alone won &apos;t do .
i hope you &apos;ll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept .
she cut the heads off of her flies .
you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain &apos;s equivalent of the catholic church , if you &apos;re an austrian like me , or the super-ego , if you &apos;re freudian , or your mother , if you &apos;re jewish .
we know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the critic &apos;s commentary is the actor .
thank you .
this is libby , or actually , this is an ultrasound image of libby .
ed : all right.tb : okay . turn it a little bit inside , a little bit toward the middle for me .
now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age .
i want to use technology that we &apos;re all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport .
and i think that &apos;s why i achieved longevity .
but i want to tell it to you the way it really happened -- not the way i present it in a scientific meeting , or the way you &apos;d read it in a scientific paper .
with a mattress below and attached to a safety rope , lynn began her 60-foot ascent .
&quot; do animals use their tails when they climb up walls ? &quot;
and watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips . this is slowed down 10 times .
so for ted we actually built a robot , over there , a prototype , with the tail .
so then we wondered , &quot; can they actually maneuver with this ? &quot;
so to conclude , i think we need to build biomutualisms , like i showed , that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application .
you know , they were marginalized in the negotiation room .
and we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
this was led by ross powell and tim naish .
so we know there &apos;s an ice shelf overhead .
this is from champion island .
and we &apos;ve been working at this fascinating uplift here in urbina bay .
and that &apos;s how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century , right ?
there &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
that is in addition to left , right , back , forth and up , down , kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see .
we go to a full-frame view of this .
now , but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded , two questions immediately arise from his observation .
until something wonderful happened in our age .
the different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us .
so can we explain those 20 numbers ?
it &apos;s a machine that will send particles around a tunnel , opposite directions , near the speed of light .
now , narrow it down to the gray one , the green one and , say , the orange one .
now , let &apos;s see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect .
so , how do we see ? well , we see by learning to see .
your brain is learning . and it &apos;s learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination ; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .
if they are under the same light , reflecting the same amount of light to your eye , then they must be equally reflective .
are we the only ones that see illusions ?
it looks like they &apos;re going to green flowers .
so , working with kids , they created images , thinking about what might the images you see and then we translated these images .
let &apos;s pull the covers off .
now there &apos;s often no right or wrong here .
2010 new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
well a couple of things : understanding of the security , of the risks , the threats , the countermeasures , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face .
health models are a great example .
as the novelty wore off , the months went by , there was some amount of tolerance , people got used to it .
what we learn is that changing models is hard .
we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe .
1982 -- i don &apos;t know if people will remember this -- there was a short epidemic of tylenol poisonings in the united states .
it &apos;s important that , if our feelings match reality , we make better security trade-offs .
what did they find ?
but she will be successful .
but with the rise of interstate trucking , it was used less and less .
it turns out we were wrong on that .
but what i found is it &apos;s in the people and how they use it that , to me , makes it so special .
they need political solutions .
we just have to persevere . &quot;
this is tahrir square .
talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
we know from our personal experiences that it &apos;s easy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fight .
now , i hope , in the coming years , that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving , among the afghans , inside the palestinian population , between the peoples of palestine and israel .
at this point , she stops me , and she says , &quot; who are you ?
why that brow ? &quot; i mean , it &apos;s such a powerful thing .
another thing i do is i invent stuff .
but some day , some day , maybe it &apos;s going to work .
it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way .
so , you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands , areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring .
but , besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting , it &apos;s also very different than the other things i do , because you get to hike around in the badlands .
you know , there &apos;s a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing , passion in life , and focusing all your energy on it , and i &apos;ve never been able to do that .
it doesn &apos;t say how things are connected , what causes what and so on .
and so it &apos;s the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct .
it requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time .
and i &apos;ll show you what that protein measurement looks like .
so this already , i think , is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine .
i think this is the big mistake .
so let me just end with giving you a little picture of what i think cancer treatment will be like in the future .
anyone remember what happened , february 3rd , 2008 ?
and from a distance it appears that it &apos;s a single group .
it will be despairing hostility .
or , &quot; i &apos;m going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that . &quot;
okay , we &apos;re going through the hallway here at zappos .
in fact , south africa has not gone down that road .
two percent are at stage one .
we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then , over time , getting them connected .
incidentally , they did pull it off .
we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward .
that so many of the city &apos;s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on .
in this captivating talk from the archive , cartoonist ben katchor reads from his comic strips . these perceptive , surreal stories find the profound hopes and foibles of history preserved in objects like light switches and signs .
to start simply , i want to say that compassion is kind .
and as a teacher of yoga , he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability , health , illness and aging .
it lodged as shards inside every aspect of the creation .
this is the full photograph , and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket , smoking a cigar .
krista tippett : reconnecting with compassion
now , i tell you this story about summer camp .
so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays : when i was going to school , we sat in rows .
we need more of a yin and yang between these two types .
and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time ?
i have a suitcase full of books .
and i call this my &quot; year of speaking dangerously . &quot;
and that &apos;s okay .
and would tell me a little bit about history too , when he &apos;d play the 1812 overture by tchaikovsky on this little victrola , and he would tell me about russia and all the things that were happening in russia at those times and why this music , in some way , represented a little bit of that history .
and a couple of years ago at amd , we came up with this idea of saying , what if we create this initiative we call 50x15 , where we are going to aim , that by the year 2015 , half of the world will be connected to the internet so that people and ideas can get connected .
and when we embarked in this initiative , from the very beginning we said it very clearly : this is not a charity .
so , we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large , and there &apos;s an infrastructure that can provide it , that a local , integrated , end-to-end system is really critical for its success .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet , and look at numbers and say , yes , that &apos;s a good business .
get up in the morning , go to work , come home and watch tv , go to bed , get up in the morning , go to work , come home , watch tv , go to bed , go to parties on weekends .
and she goes , &quot; well , i see jesus , &quot; and started crying and left .
so , what is it for ?
they never really codify it or qualify it or quantify it , and say , &quot; this is what i believe in .
it makes a difference what you believe .
that &apos;s the way we were wired , i believe , by god .
and , by the way , your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth .
now , i &apos;m reading this thing , and i &apos;m going , what is that all about ?
what do you do with a shepherd &apos;s staff ?
that , to me , is the primary question about life .
thank you .
and that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .
and then we can actually roll out large numbers .
the human species , in general , is fallible -- okay fine .
but the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
so we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
i &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
we just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
the effect of this , of course , is it &apos;s not just amber waves of grain , it is mountains of stuff .
but in the meantime , for the next decade at least , the name of the game is hydrocarbons . and be that oil , be that gas , be that coal , this is what we &apos;re dealing with . and before i make this talk too long , here &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the current energy system .
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world &apos;s greatest toilet scrubber .
but unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
it was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the himalayan peaks .
wow , that &apos;s interesting .
i like it .
we &apos;re not asking anything that &apos;s intangible .
we don &apos;t have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits , we can have both .
it &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
so what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
but we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . it &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
it &apos;s forever freely accessible by biology letters .
what &apos;s the point ? the point is what science does for us .
so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there &apos;s a spill ; they &apos;re a problem where there &apos;s not .
recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic , the burning of the plastic , which releases incredible toxic chemicals and , once again , kills people .
but guess what ? you &apos;re so clever , but you &apos;re not as clever as a clam .
when we take on topics like this , it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow , and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we &apos;ve been in .
on the ground , it &apos;s powered electrically .
so the issue then , i &apos;ve often asked , is when is it going to happen ?
we are now installing larger powerplants , which will make it possible for me to get back on board .
the computers back up each other . there &apos;s a voting system -- if one computer is not agreeing with the other three , it &apos;s kicked out of the system .
the thought that you wouldn &apos;t want to transfer electric power wirelessly , no one ever thought of that .
think about that .
you know . what about safety ?
that coil is connected to an r.f. amplifier that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field .
so , i wanted to show you something .
eric giler wants to untangle our wired lives with cable-free electric power . here , he covers what this sci-fi tech offers , and demos mit &apos;s breakthrough version , witricity -- a near-to-market invention that may soon recharge your cell phone , car , pacemaker .
i think there &apos;s a better solution .
i &apos;m wearing the second prototype of this burial suit .
i talk to him for hours .
he coached little league for our son .
he started it just two weeks ago .
both of them said the same thing : do nothing if there is no further hope .
so what the experts call &quot; denial , &quot; i call &quot; hope , &quot; and i &apos;d like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design .
and he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
with graphics , computing power , low latencies , these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives .
so a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy , he &apos;s got the web cam ?
i &apos;ll wrap up by showing you the -- this is a brand-new peek i haven &apos;t really shown into the lab area of virtual earth .
look at the skyline of shanghai .
so if i were to ask you , &quot; which is china and which is india , and which country has grown faster ? &quot;
is democracy bad for economic growth ?
burma didn &apos;t succeed .
life expectancies : as early as 1965 , china had a huge advantage in life expectancy .
actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
if you are a nba player and you are always being compared to michael jordan , you &apos;re going to look not so impressive .
and the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the enlightenment , in part , because of what people were drinking there .
i mean , this is what is happening inside your brain .
we take ideas from other people , from people we &apos;ve learned from , from people we run into in the coffee shop , and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new .
they want to say , &quot; there i was , i was standing there and i had it all suddenly clear in my head . &quot;
so , in a sense , we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property , you know , building barricades , having secretive r &amp; amp ; d labs , patenting everything that we have , so that those ideas will remain valuable , and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas , and the culture will be more innovative .
and they start writing the kind of date stamp , time stamps for each little bleep that they record .
and now , i guarantee you certainly half of this room , if not more , has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space .
buffett likes to point out that in 1992 , the combined wealth of the people on the forbes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest americans -- was 300 billion dollars .
just think about it .
well , a few things .
and in contrast with the industrial revolution , the titans of our new economy aren &apos;t creating that many new jobs .
chrystia freeland : the rise of the new global super-rich
so i go down to the ward and see jim , and his skin his translucent like this .
the reason why this is all happening is due to this , these are the four ways to go .
ninety-eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice , and that this is how things should work .
i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it &apos;s going .
my grandmother survived and married my grandfather .
and being naive about the whole field , i kind of thought , &quot; oh , you have cell death in alzheimer &apos;s which is causing the memory deficit , and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth . &quot;
so this really , really fascinated me .
and furthermore , that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer , and brain cells are also terminally differentiated .
and , furthermore , when skeletal muscle is injured , that &apos;s what causes chemokines -- these signals saying , &quot; cancer , you can come to me , &quot; the &quot; go signs &quot; for the tumors -- it causes them to highly express these chemokines .
i spent a few days photographing children in different countries , and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists , i always hope that when my pictures were published , they might actually have an effect on a situation , instead of just documenting it .
the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors , so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor .
and i would stand at attention , and all the girls would crack up , and it was sort of a little joke .
and i said , &quot; look , i think i &apos;ll scare the grandmother to death , if i actually write to her and tell her that you &apos;re willing to adopt her , i want to go back and talk to her . &quot;
so i said , &quot; listen , it &apos;s really cold , i &apos;ve come a very long way , do you mind if i just come in for a minute ? i &apos;m freezing . &quot;
and she said , &quot; well , he &apos;s saying , &apos; who the hell are you to walk into my house , some rich american with your cameras around your neck , accusing me of enslaving my niece ?
hyun-sook stayed at father keene &apos;s , and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .
the uncle went back to his family , and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner .
so , the two of us were just like , &quot; oh my god , oh my god . &quot;
he says , &quot; we &apos;ve got to stop the smoke . &quot;
this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .
now , remember the picture , how much she looked like her grandmother , at the beginning ?
natasha &apos;s actually never heard me tell the story .
but there was no evidence .
well , let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that i &apos;m here to tell you today .
and we didn &apos;t have the evidence for that .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
so that &apos;s what we are building from the left side of the river .
life on earth is the size of the earth .
this tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the copernican principle , it &apos;s all wrong .
but first , i have a new invention here .
in spite of pepfar , the generous pepfar , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .
so , is it poverty ?
arab countries not so much , but iran is quite high .
probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
and this chart goes back to 1500 .
that &apos;s a great question .
but this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot;
the scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the oriental world in a number of crucial ways , the most important being that , through the experimental method , it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before .
it doesn &apos;t rise any faster after these countries become independent .
in terms of patents , there &apos;s no question that the east is ahead .
winston churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938 .
so my story really is as much about that convergence in the americas as it &apos;s a convergence story in eurasia .
there are over 40,000 described species of spiders .
and this is what we see .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
this is an area that &apos;s largely unexplored but here &apos;s a little bit of data i can show you .
i love when i &apos;m in the laboratory , a new spider silk sequence comes in .
colorful characters , and a good time is had by all .
you have to have legal structure .
these are photos on flickr tagged &quot; iraq . &quot;
if you go down to one percent , exclude 99 percent of the group effort , you &apos;re still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos .
but when you &apos;re down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos;s institution as obstacle .
the fact that a single programmer can , without having to move into a professional relation to an institution , improve linux once and never be seen from again , should terrify ballmer .
want to publish globally anything you think today ?
what &apos;s happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we &apos;re used to , came from the institutions that were framing them , and not from the infrastructure .
we finally , after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option , we &apos;re finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them .
the other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment .
and then we take those units and we shape them . we give them a little pre-shape , usually a round or a little torpedo shape , sometimes .
again , transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread .
we can plant those in the ground .
and we know it &apos;s alive because in stage three , it grows . growth is the proof of life .
or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .
thank you .
they &apos;re all mounted on my instruments .
it &apos;s a bunch of crazy pictographic notation .
this is &quot; tlön , &quot; for three conductors and no players .
and i follow this question , not worrying about &quot; is it music ? &quot; -- not worrying about the definition of the thing that i &apos;m making .
i tasted the broccoli . mmmmm . &quot;
on one side is a new caledonian crow .
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
but unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
he told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
so we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
i &apos;m going to talk about a technology that we &apos;re developing at oxford now , that we think is going to change the way that computer games and hollywood movies are being made .
if i push chris a bit , like this , for example , he &apos;ll react to it .
so that was the idea behind this .
what we really wanted was a full human body .
that &apos;s something that you cannot do right now .
so , here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked .
i &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen , and they &apos;re going to hit the screen quite soon , actually , for some major productions .
so , you kick the guy and the guy &apos;s supposed to counter-balance .
it &apos;s called &quot; pop-it , &quot; and it &apos;s about the things little kids do with their parents .
it was a very beautiful time .
and conversely , only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them .
and what i &apos;ve noticed is -- first of all , you get an incredible amount of email .
it &apos;s in your tedgift bag . no , no .
and it came out . it was called microsoft write .
if they continue at this pace , there &apos;s absolutely no telling where they might wind up .
he says , &quot; nice talk . &quot; and i said , &quot; thank you , what do you do here ? &quot;
we &apos;ve entered planet domination mode .
thank you . so steve jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty . and the truth is , for years i was a little depressed -- because americans obviously did not value it , because the mac had three percent market share and windows had 95 percent market share .
i also use this feature called voice macros . period . &quot;
what technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty ?
and in this case , piling on more technology doesn &apos;t solve the problem , because it only super-empowers people more .
so after giving up on the book -- and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago , and to work through venture capital on the innovative side , and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems .
they all need clean water , they need energy , they need transportation , and we want them to develop in a green way .
so inside of a nanotube , we &apos;re really at the limit here .
we need -- we don &apos;t know where this thing is going .
we may not be able to stop it , but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem .
something i never talk about in scientific meetings is how i actually got to this state and why i do the work that i do .
whether or not you think it &apos;s likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe .
how do you know it when you find it ?
this is cueva de villa luz in tabasco , in mexico , and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid .
they take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them .
we face the problem of , how can we do this robotically ?
now , my view of what the current status of potential life on mars is that it &apos;s probably been on the planet , maybe one in two chances .
so this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals , right -- so they hold us to it .
and b was last heard of in the pope &apos;s library about a hundred miles north of rome in viterbo in 1311 .
but it &apos;s not in an institution , it was bought by a private owner in 1998 .
another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax , because this was used in the liturgical services of the greek orthodox church and they &apos;d used candle wax .
if you process the same two images in a different way , you can actually get rid of the prayer book text .
but we wanted it to look at atoms , at iron atoms , so that we could read the page from before and after .
but if you can &apos;t win , then you should fight for a noble cause , because then you &apos;ll be remembered .
it &apos;s going to be built by users , by people who get this data together , by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from , all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from , people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things .
the original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century .
it was like , 160 dollars for this ?
it has four balconies .
but in the blind taste test , it came in last .
there &apos;s a water jet that cleans you .
and if i was a billionaire , i would get one .
and then i tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways .
in four years &apos; time , it &apos;s estimated it &apos;ll be worth over 80 billion dollars .
it gives you great powers .
and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data .
but we &apos;re in virtuality . these aren &apos;t real boxes .
you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
when someone is more likely to remember , we can give them a nugget in a window .
in terms of education , perhaps most obviously of all , we can transform how we engage people .
the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites and our immune response .
we also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and dna related to diet .
while i was working at the u.n. , i met this girl . her name is lauren bush .
so those seem like two bifurcated problems , but i kind of started to think about , you know , what is obesity and hunger ? what are both those things about ?
it &apos;s crazy .
and we know what &apos;s happened in the past , so if we start now , and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term , we might be able to recreate the food system so when i give my next talk and i &apos;m 60 years old , i &apos;ll be able to say that it &apos;s been a success .
now , i think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today .
take joint positions with your client .
now , the first issue that we faced was that the dallas theater center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of new york , chicago and seattle .
now , superfly , the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower , and you smear them across flytower and auditorium .
now , imagine what that could be . i have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long .
in this case what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re taking the orchestra floor , lifting it up , spinning it , changing the rake , taking it back to flat floor , changing the rake again . in essence , you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating , at will .
so , the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic , light-controlled , sound-controlled , great acoustics , great intimacy shakespeare , but can also do beckett with the skyline of dallas sitting behind it .
joshua prince-ramus : building a theater that remakes itself
and that suddenly , people , en masse , were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives .
weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent . so the sunny ones swirl around , the cloudy ones float along , the rainy ones fall down , and the snowy ones flutter to the ground .
and that water that you see there is the open lead , and through that lead , bowhead whales migrate north each springtime .
i built a web interface for viewing &quot; the whale hunt &quot; that attempts to do just this .
and now we &apos;ve whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs , and then we can enter the narrative at that position .
so i &apos;m going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did , some of the people i spoke with .
a 24-year-old truck driver .
she was chewing betel nut , which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red .
jh : i hope it &apos;s everything that you hope it will be .
it &apos;s almost like they &apos;re practicing magic tricks .
and i think , kind of , as a surgeon , he basically said , &quot; kid , i saved your life .
or at least , they shouldn &apos;t if they &apos;re interested in reproducing . that -- is not the way any human being speaks casually .
once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message , then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak .
this julie says , &quot; so what &apos;s up ? &quot;
you don &apos;t just zip right into it .
and so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today , not consciously , of course , but it &apos;s an expansion of their linguistic repertoire .
we used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were .
in the words of president obama , &quot; if the taliban take over again , they will invite back al-qaeda , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . &quot;
we went from almost no afghans having mobile telephones during the taliban to a situation where , almost overnight , three million afghans had mobile telephones .
now is this a new idea ?
you feel deep , deep guilt .
refugee return , which the united nations high commission for refugees thought would be extremely unlikely , has largely happened .
it &apos;s about context .
in doing so , we &apos;ve destroyed our credibility with the security council , which means it &apos;s very difficult to get a resolution on syria , and we &apos;re setting ourselves up again for failure .
what you see here is a prototypic device .
it just -- you don &apos;t want to do that .
they &apos;ll make , we estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day they &apos;d make about 10 million tests a year .
what the guy actually meant was that he &apos;d fed a 30-day dose of dapsone to his dog , that morning .
i don &apos;t know whether the idea of one computer , one child makes any sense . here &apos;s the computer of the future , because this screen is already there and they &apos;re ubiquitous .
what happens if you don &apos;t have an electricity , and a centrifuge , and whatever ?
so , i actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people .
there is a book written called , &quot; what &apos;s the matter with kansas ? &quot;
this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country .
in cites , about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race , but in rural communities , only about 30 percent .
i think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
four or five opportunities to see the breast masses , touch the breast mass , intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her .
she says , &quot; i left him with my sister at leith . &quot;
laennec , it is said , was walking in the streets of paris and saw two children playing with a stick .
i call it the ipatient .
now you and i could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts .
and i remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and i had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which i had a role and the patient had a role .
i &apos;m an infectious disease physician , and in the early days of hiv , before we had our medications , i presided over so many scenes like this .
i will see you through this .
no , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias .
science is not a thing . it &apos;s a verb .
you don &apos;t even need photoshop ; you don &apos;t need high-tech equipment ; you don &apos;t need computers .
you &apos;re turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain .
and we went down , investigated .
all right , i &apos;m going to just end with a positive , nice , little story about -- the skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization .
michael shermer : why people believe weird things
four million of these babies die annually .
you can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it &apos;s able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time , after which you simply reheat the pouch .
there is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals , but -- they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons .
he connected with people who cared about this : nonprofessionals , people with passion .
so we shift gears for a minute , and say , &quot; i know : television ; advertising . push push .
so you &apos;ve got the red-hat ladies over here .
it &apos;s easy to look at what i &apos;ve said so far , and say , &quot; wait a minute , i don &apos;t have what it takes to be that kind of leader . &quot;
what all these people have in common is that they are heretics .
because if you &apos;re not upsetting anyone , you &apos;re not changing the status quo .
they want to be missed the day they don &apos;t show up .
but also , it &apos;s extremely expensive , costing 800 dollars per test , and it &apos;s grossly inaccurate , missing 30 percent of all pancreatic cancers .
essentially , i could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein , but also , due to the properties of these nanotubes , it would change its electrical properties based on the amount of protein present .
but it was shortly afterwards that i discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like a million holes in it , and over the course of seven months , i painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes .
now , according to proponents of the clash of civilizations , barbie and fulla occupy these completely separate spheres .
now , these are the world &apos;s first islamic superheroes .
or , the next question would be , can we want what we already have ?
and we think it &apos;s a given , and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that .
radiant , as in self-sustaining .
what do you seek to express there ?
&quot; i turn myself on when ... &quot; because most of the time , people like to ask the question , &quot; you turn me on , what turns me on , &quot; and i &apos;m out of the question . you know ?
translate this into adult language .
they know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has .
but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i had written , or was writing at the time , didn &apos;t sound all that great in some of those halls .
i think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls .
so far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like frank sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
it &apos;s more a social situation than a musical situation .
so birds do it too .
and i was so stimulated .
i have phlebitis at the moment , in both legs , and that &apos;s the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here , because i have parkinson &apos;s disease in addition to that , and some other problems that i won &apos;t talk about .
over again and again in the psalms , which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world , david describes the evils of the human race .
and many of you , i &apos;m sure , have thought about that and puzzled over it .
and i &apos;d been to russia several times under the communists , and they &apos;d given me marvelous freedom that i didn &apos;t expect .
we have families that self-destruct , friends that betray us .
and it &apos;s often difficult for young people to understand that .
the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind . &quot;
equally well known is pascal &apos;s wager .
i couldn &apos;t prove it .
everyone can be wrong .
you don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
language can &apos;t math me .
harvest witness , smoke .
two months later , i go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief .
she &apos;s 19 ; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them .
when these girls sit , you unlock intelligence , you unlock passion , you unlock commitment , you unlock focus , you unlock great leaders .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- i failed , i failed , i failed .
i &apos;m looking for ways for other girls to be with me .
leymah , thank you . thank you so much for coming to ted .
we require high-end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing .
or take another example : big data .
they found a treasure trove of documents : 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters .
there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference , other geospatial data , none of it integrated .
now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .
do three hours &apos; work .
so i joined a gym . &quot;
because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
as a black person in america , i am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health .
so how did things get so different for us ?
who profits ? does anything justify what the local community goes through ?
and they provide habitats for our little friends !
and we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
for his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore reminded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wasting our energy , intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count .
she wrote back to me and she said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &apos;s day cards for their mothers . &quot;
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
and as i move my hand , i can pop the balloons or i can move the bug .
so i showed him .
again , it &apos;s useful to think about this analogy with language .
this is completely different than automobiles .
i want to talk about this .
we &apos;re interested in finding beauty that &apos;s more than just an aesthetic ; it &apos;s really a truth .
all right ? now one thing about art is , art is discovery , and art is discovering yourself through your art . right ?
hopefully , really understand the customer at its heart , where the customer is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
the engineers flew over , and designers got together with them , and they put their presentation together .
and somebody asked me about catherine , my wife , you know , did she fly out with me or something ?
american designer chris bangle explains his philosophy that car design is an art form in its own right , with an entertaining -- and ultimately moving -- account of the bmw group &apos;s deep blue project , intended to create the suv of the future .
and this is the 21st century .
this got us very excited .
because now when we &apos;ve shared this molecule , just since december of last year , with 40 laboratories in the united states and 30 more in europe -- many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space , to target this rare cancer that , thankfully right now , is quite desirable to study in that industry .
this string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses that can be texted , i suppose , or twittered worldwide , is the chemical identity of our pro compound .
it &apos;s extremely beautiful .
keeping the universe very , very smooth at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a delicate arrangement .
unfortunately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough attention to .
it is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other .
he said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
they will fall into black holes .
that &apos;s because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken .
my english lost , i wanted to vomit .
i read books , science books , especially physics .
i say to you , trust yourself and believe .
i thought , &quot; why can i not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world ? &quot;
but later , i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels , also .
once it has that information , it finds out more reviews about that , or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that , so you can actually hear , on a physical book , this was obama &apos;s visit last week to mit .
here , i &apos;m taking a part of a document and putting over here a second part from a second place -- and i &apos;m actually modifying the information that i have over there .
and now , if you see , it &apos;s more about the cost-effectiveness : this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20,000 surface tables , or anything like that .
we had to beat the powerful japanese with all of their technology .
it &apos;s going to be a place where people can meet , where you can put nature .
this station has the same comfort , the same features as a subway station .
this was an old building in a favela in rio -- &#91; unclear favela name &#93; -- that we just transformed into a primary school , with high quality .
but the reason i could come here is because of that .
ep : okay , so you &apos;re showing now some public services .
eduardo paes : the 4 commandments of cities
the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes .
i mean , you can &apos;t expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape .
they go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
we find beauty in something done well .
so we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch .
so starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system , a vibrating vest , a click wheel with voice commands , a leg strip , even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot .
so basically that &apos;s how it works .
how are we going to handle insurance ?
this was the beginning . the voice had arrived .
helplessly and hopelessly , i began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions .
strategic .
and likewise , for survivors of distress and adversity , that we remember we don &apos;t have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us .
just buy the software , you design it . i won &apos;t say anymore , you can take it on from there . it &apos;s going to happen , and i think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural , becomes part of the human condition , something that everybody &apos;s familiar with and everybody accepts .
but we can look outside , very cheaply and in a simple fashion .
and the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
so as you go further away from the sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
but in the long run , if there &apos;s no life there , we create it ourselves .
i mean , in retrospect , probably stupid questions , but things like , &quot; what &apos;s this caps lock key for ? &quot;
so , the light bulb actually does that .
and this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is , because it &apos;s never done , you have to do all this other stuff .
i didn &apos;t really want to , from the previous adventure .
these are the dispensers . there &apos;s this friendly shape .
and then the clouds came over us , and then , boom ! this massive thunderclap , and sheets of rain .
not me .
they took off her colorful sari .
she said , &quot; the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires and strongly supports literacy .
their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different .
but she was sick with worry : she worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier , she worried her daughters would be raped , she worried for their lives .
as the senior officer approaches with a baton , layma stands up with deliberation , reaches her arms up over her head , and begins , very slowly , to untie her headdress that covers her hair .
and they need allies from their communities .
i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked .
in essence , could we &quot; app &quot; chemistry ?
lee cronin : print your own medicine
so the rituals came that way .
but also the non-muslim communities of north africa -- the animists , even some christians and even a jewish tribe in north africa is known to practice female circumcision .
islam actually , as a monotheistic religion , which defined man as a responsible agent by itself , created the idea of the individual in the middle east and saved it from the communitarianism , the collectivism of the tribe .
and that &apos;s why the ottoman empire in its last decades turned into a proto-democracy , a constitutional monarchy , and freedom was a very important political value at the time .
so in the 20th century , you had this vicious cycle in the arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the islamic-pious , and they &apos;re reacting in reactionary ways .
they said that &quot; we want freedom ; we want democracy .
and that &apos;s because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it , put it under even a very powerful microscope , there &apos;s nothing there .
and there &apos;s several ways of doing this , but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies .
civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now , and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat .
this is a decrease by two-thirds .
crucially , for the long-term success of the peace process in northern ireland , he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations .
central among them are three .
yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have .
our journey starts in space , where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
they still do what they &apos;ve done for ages , their enemies long gone .
in australia , a lily turned into a grass tree , and in hawaii , a daisy became a silver sword .
primates emerge from jungles , as tarsiers first , becoming lemurs not much later .
they then go on to create an event , and beyond that , a foundation to support that .
i said to him , &quot; i &apos;ve got the most amazing idea that &apos;s going to transform your organization . &quot;
we had mo bros from canada , from the u.s. , and from the u.k. emailing us and calling us and saying , hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i say to them , &quot; last year we were fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors . &quot;
&quot; but i went home for thanksgiving dinner , and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on . &quot;
i met benki three years ago in sao paulo when i &apos;d brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world , because we wanted to learn from each other .
he &apos;s created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods .
you also know that we can &apos;t just keep doing what we &apos;ve always done , because we &apos;ll get the results we &apos;ve always gotten .
when i asked sanghamitra , &quot; how did you get from english literature to hiv / aids ? &quot;
it &apos;s the spirit inside . &quot;
but they have qualities we &apos;d all recognize .
fields wicker-miurin : learning from leadership &apos;s missing manual
there is my world and there is your world , and my world is always better than your world , because my world , you see , is rational and yours is superstition .
alexander &apos;s mother , his parents , his teacher aristotle told him the story of homer &apos;s &quot; iliad . &quot;
but they were not two characters on two different adventures .
one linear , one cyclical .
there are many promised lands , depending on your station in society , depending on your stage of life .
so , i had to teach it to myself .
how do you enhance the sensitivity of people to indian-ness .
and it &apos;s a very dangerous question , because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence .
so the people looking for good jobs are going to fail .
it &apos;s the one mommy and daddy told me about .
passion , interest -- it &apos;s not the same thing .
you &apos;re going to fail , because , because you &apos;re not going to do it , because you will have invented a new excuse , any excuse to fail to take action , and this excuse i &apos;ve heard so many times .
might fail , kid . don &apos;t make a lot of money at that , kid .
great friend , great spouse , great parent , great career .
she and i were both very pregnant at that time , and my heart just ached for her , imagining how afraid she must be .
the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities , followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense .
the machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive .
so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- michael hacked off the x-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out , and we attached the new detector , and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging , or mbi .
after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors , we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g. komen foundation .
but you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo .
it is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations .
that &apos;s the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have .
so what should we be doing with that guy &apos;s data ?
yeah , that &apos;s a terrifying result .
he was worried about right and wrong .
i mean , think about that . how grand . how ambitious .
you just look at the consequences and see if , overall , it &apos;s for the good or for the worse .
so let &apos;s cut to the chase .
what did i do ? did i follow my gut ?
well that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s a different way of thinking .
basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
you shout . you say , &quot; blah blah blah , blah blah blah . who is this guy ? &quot;
and the irony for me was of course , i didn &apos;t do that for the sake of science progress .
and it means , right , you are in the recovery .
when i bring the 10 living and self-moving benches in the exhibition room , john was just beside me , and was like , &quot; hmm . hmm . &quot;
so your sofa , your plastic chair , your kid &apos;s toys give their own invisible reality . and this one is very toxic .
because you can grow some potatoes .
naming science as his chief inspiration , mathieu lehanneur shows a selection of his ingenious designs -- an interactive noise-neutralizing ball , an antibiotic course in one layered pill , asthma treatment that reminds kids to take it , a living air filter , a living-room fish farm and more .
and so it wasn &apos;t really a career .
he &apos;s a south asian -- very dark-skinned south asian .
by morning , the gang leader arrived , checked out sudhir , decided he was no threat and they let him go home .
they get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling .
the money looks about the same .
and then all of my friends said : &quot; maybe i should go do that , too . &quot;
so in the words of one of the members of the gang i think makes this clear .
i started with paragliding .
so my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before .
question one : so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does ?
so you have to be prepared .
obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative .
&quot; what does it matter ? &quot;
it &apos;s made out of ice .
it was also about giving the city a sense of dimension .
so art , in that sense , i think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we &apos;re moving into , particularly right now .
the tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters .
there are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine .
nathalia crane was a little girl from brooklyn .
and my blood froze when i read that because i had written the plain-song music 130 years after he &apos;d written the letter .
this is a dolphin that is self-aware .
look at this body .
i work with a lot of musicians from around the world , and often we don &apos;t have any common language at all , but we sit down behind our instruments , and suddenly there &apos;s a way for us to connect and emote .
then , when i first came to ted , which was where i met peter , i showed this .
the dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what &apos;s going on here tonight .
when bob and i did this design , we thought we were building a system to connect computers together .
so first of all , thank you , and i would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each , and we thank you for that .
dr : thank you . vc : thank you .
so i &apos;m like , whoa .
so . and now it &apos;s communication .
because you &apos;re not in the middle east .
some girl that we met on facebook never been in israel , born and raised in iran , lives in germany , afraid of israelis because of what she knows about us , decides after a few months of talking on the internet with some israelis to come to israel , and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says , &quot; okay , not that big a deal . &quot;
thank you guys .
we mate them . they have sort of mutant offspring .
we scaled the building up three times to chinese proportions , and went to china .
it &apos;s almost like a fragment of danish culture integrated into chinese culture .
so quite often you load water for ballast .
this is the view from my apartment , over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the leonardo dicaprio balcony .
and there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens , in one or two years it will sort of transform into a cambodian temple ruin , completely covered in green .
so we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem , exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants , and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings .
there are 800 million people starving .
and that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated .
you know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
yet it would do very little good .
we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
i find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
to make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
there &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
thus , there &apos;s understandably a deep-seated presumption among westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth , liberal democracy , and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights .
we see that in china , 28 percent of people had secondary school access .
if your per capita income is between 2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year , then you &apos;re likely to only get 33 years of democracy .
some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights .
i spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness -- trying to see if i can actually train my mind in a particular way , like i can train my body , so i can end up with an improved feeling of overall well-being .
now this does matter .
if i make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer , the easiest answer , of course , is do more of the stuff that i like to do and much less of the stuff that i don &apos;t like to do -- for which it would be helpful to know what it is that i actually do like to do .
stefan sagmeister : 7 rules for making more happiness
and this is a static culture .
what i &apos;m looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that i need .
suzanne lee : grow your own clothes
so i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south china factory city called dongguan .
how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car , to get married , or to put my child through school ?
and yet , his view of the world persists , and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses , to imagine that we can know what they &apos;re really thinking .
their parents are often illiterate , and then they come to the city , and they , on their own , at night , during the weekends , they &apos;ll take a computer class , they &apos;ll take an english class , and learn really , really rudimentary things , you know , like how to type a document in word , or how to say really simple things in english .
young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies .
the children are virtual prisoners ; they cannot leave , they cannot go home .
boy : on the day of judgment , god will ask me , &quot; why did you do that ? &quot;
whether or not there are living organisms there , of course , is an entirely different matter .
it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on .
but in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive , as expansive as you can imagine .
then you can see the english engineers looking on .
and a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built .
the design is quite extraordinary .
now this is an engine component .
if i gave you a 3d printer , you wouldn &apos;t know how to direct it to make what you want it to .
imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact , so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you &apos;re about to buy .
and the idea of now creating implants , scanning data , an mri scan of somebody can now be converted into 3d data and we can create very specific implants for them .
it &apos;s a very powerful word , jihad , if you look at it in that respect , and there &apos;s a certain almost mystical resonance to it .
why do you keep using the word jihad in your friday sermons ?
they &apos;re fighting battles over much narrower issues .
who ended the global jihad ?
satellite television and the internet are informing and empowering young muslims in exciting new ways .
and it &apos;s known for prostitution , violence , drugs : a hard place to grow up .
she had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization , jamii bora , that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were , as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings .
i said , &quot; well what about your dreams ? &quot;
this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month .
when i gave up sugar for 30 days , day 31 looked like this .
but then , in the second year of caltech , they started grading .
some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life .
so for direct light , it takes only one bounce , for off-axis light it might take two , and for extreme off-axis , it might take three .
so we looked at this engine , and this had some potential .
so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator , which didn &apos;t work out for us , to optimize the stirling engine , and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar , irrespective of weight , irrespective of size , to get the most conversion of solar energy , because the sun is free .
we built engines -- so we built 100 different engines over the last two years .
the way the unit works is , when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here .
but the hot sport right around las vegas and death valley and that area is very , very good .
of course , now i &apos;m very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake .
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene .
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
my older sister was busy torturing my parents , and they were busy torturing her .
it was a very high , it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say , the content is what &apos;s important , not the package , not the wrapping .
i don &apos;t know what a plot means .
so i decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift , it needed a few illustrations .
ok . so , the first one i was very timid , and i &apos;ll begin .
facts were actually banished from our home .
so now , my friends , if that is true , and it is true , what is the point ? &quot;
and then i go and have some tea .
td : but it didn &apos;t turn out to be so fun and entertaining , as i thought it would have been .
but the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the muslim and buddhist traditions .
his holiness the karmapa : the technology of the heart
but this machine doesn &apos;t know what it looks like .
when i say &quot; we , &quot; i &apos;m at the council on foreign relations .
but nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak .
most of the spending in the bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results and bio-terrorism threat .
unfortunately it &apos;s made against the current form of h5n1 .
we don &apos;t know how important hand washing is for flu -- shocking . one assumes it &apos;s a good idea to wash your hands a lot .
and then you &apos;re on your own because the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months .
as a nation , no we &apos;re not .
otherwise you &apos;re in trouble .
lg : right . so i have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic .
but it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all .
these are from remote control airplanes .
but here i am .
passion is the motto of all my actions .
tenacity is how i kept at it against all odds .
notre dame , the sydney harbor bridge , the world trade center .
in fact , i put my world trade center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks -- or some completely different type of performance .
the mayor of jerusalem , teddy kollek , comes to wish me the best .
somebody somewhere , a group of people , starts clapping in rhythm with my steps .
the most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy .
they have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water .
and especially , you know , as a small brown woman in a little college , in the upper northwest part of our country , far away from the areas of power and money , i really have to ask myself , &quot; what can i do about this ?
we brought musicians to the canopy , and they made their music -- and it &apos;s fantastic music .
they were incredibly enthusiastic about the work .
in these partnerships , i have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into it people , and movie star people , and scientists , but when we share nature , when we share our perspectives about nature , we find a common denominator .
well , that &apos;s not exactly the story , because the problem was that parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data , and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them .
so i &apos;ve told you a bit about what i did to try and drag parliament , kicking and screaming , into the 21st century , and i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people i know are doing .
you &apos;ve got to have skepticism and humility .
they &apos;ve kidded out the house with cctv cameras .
i had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs .
and the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take .
at the time , i wasn &apos;t the only one who didn &apos;t know what i was doing -- almost nobody did .
and , the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister .
this is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives .
now little fishes and invertebrates aren &apos;t the only things we see down there .
so sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .
when we first found it , we weren &apos;t even sure what family this thing belonged to , so we just called it the dr. seuss fish , because it looked like something out of one of those books .
he had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned .
but here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ .
they don &apos;t come back several times , so it really chronicles a journey .
and i came home and i said to my father and mother , &quot; i just met this man : doesn &apos;t have much work , and he &apos;s sort of ugly , funny voice , and he &apos;s a teacher at school .
your father , is he alive ?
you have to understand that .
would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence ?
that line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage .
so , our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history developing life , not anticipating its emergence .
we &apos;ve been searching ever since , but it &apos;s impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains .
i think it &apos;s a problem of completion and delivery , because the fine print said , &quot; what game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see ? &quot;
the ice of antarctica glows with a light so dazzling , it blinds the unprotected eye .
ten times a day , they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow , season after season for thousands of years .
the truth is , we only know the outlines , and what we don &apos;t completely understand , we can &apos;t properly fix .
the new story about climate protection is that it &apos;s not costly , but profitable .
china has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology .
they make a little net money for the treasury .
so there &apos;s huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter .
so you got rid of the body shop .
and for each car so financed , scrap almost one clunker , preferably the dirtiest ones .
and the one thing i &apos;d like to point out here is that we &apos;ve done this before .
the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life ; that we can do good things , that there are things worth doing because they &apos;re good things to do , and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them .
we &apos;ve made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and pr for this brand , purple moon .
girl 11 : because my older sister , she gets everything and , like , when i ask my mom for something , she &apos;ll say , &quot; no &quot; -- all the time .
if we were playing the game , that &apos;s what we &apos;d do .
and like hitler , goering fancied himself a collector of art .
now goering was , by all accounts , a terrible man .
i want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we react to things .
it &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way .
of course , it was the same man , but she was seeing him in different ways .
that causes a huge drop in the value .
when this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing .
one lovely experiment was done by kurt gray and dan wegner .
and these are just some of the examples .
but we &apos;re also unimpressed by authority , because it &apos;s so easy to contrive .
and here &apos;s another example .
so this is what they were going to do in their trial .
what i find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices , but slightly more sophisticated versions of them , in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients , and which we use to make vitally important decisions .
how can we explain this strange phenomenon ?
this is a drug that i myself have prescribed to patients .
we cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information .
and then i asked myself the question .
and you &apos;ve got to feel that .
and you know why they have a design ?
when he was gassing the kurds and gassing iran , they didn &apos;t care about it .
well , obviously , when people die in the war , they are muslims , they are iraqis -- they &apos;re not americans .
if they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
i mean , these christians , they &apos;re nuts . how would they do this to their little kids ? &quot;
and of course , most of you don &apos;t support the insurgency ; you don &apos;t support killing americans ; you don &apos;t support the terrorists .
it &apos;s an american , american soldiers , american woman who lost her loved one in the middle east -- in iraq or afghanistan .
can you go there ?
i &apos;m not saying that i support the terrorists in iraq , but as a sociologist , what i am saying is i understand .
and perhaps most remarkably , at the beginning of the 21st century , really for the first time in modern history , growth extended to almost all parts of the world .
now this is not new . this is practically not new to tedsters .
the way i like to put this is : one idea . ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market .
india is coming on line .
but some of our grandchildren probably will .
you can see this in the data .
out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition , crystallized in the wish that i &apos;m about to make to you .
it &apos;s been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil -- contains approximately four million species of bacteria , all unknown .
we do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment , including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria .
only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status .
i wish you would help them .
the carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere .
all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue , because down in there is what is called ancient dna .
so this meeting in boston led to three things .
this one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes , but alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then , and this will move ahead , and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern spain .
and so the red list is really important , keep track of what &apos;s endangered and critically endangered , and so on .
you know , do you want extinct species back ?
well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling .
an author visited our school , jack gantos .
i had art .
just stop drawing in my class . &quot;
celebrate your own style . don &apos;t draw the way you &apos;re being told to draw .
and i sent out one last batch of postcards .
&quot; punk farm , &quot; &quot; baghead , &quot; &quot; ollie the purple elephant . &quot;
how does this work ? well , two ways .
now , that &apos;s a little unfair . some of my best friends are architects . and they definitely do have ears .
and finally , after susan cain &apos;s wonderful tedtalk in february , we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they &apos;re in a noisy environment doing group work .
and in our offices , we spend a lot of time at work .
and our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers .
i didn &apos;t use it as a special effect , but as a partner on stage .
i know theater can improve the quality of people &apos;s lives , and i know theater can heal .
in the art of today , we become scientists .
and to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day , i want to show you some images of the book .
this actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice .
great -- and then i didn &apos;t hear from them for weeks , so i called , and i asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on with the heart valve ? &quot;
a colleague said to me one time , &quot; they don &apos;t pay me to like the kids .
one year i came up with a bright idea .
&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; i ain &apos;t all bad . &quot;
we &apos;re born to make a difference .
a transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there : &quot; sam devoured the pizza . &quot; you can &apos;t just say , &quot; sam devoured . &quot;
to give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have .
he needn &apos;t go anywhere . he could have been in bed the whole time , but it &apos;s as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving .
now , mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type , and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward .
in that case , the consequences are rather severe .
one is , why do we argue ? who benefits from arguments ?
no opposition , no adversariality , not necessarily any arguing in the adversarial sense .
i think those are deforming effects , and worst of all , it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration .
this guy &apos;s a good arguer .
can you do that ? i think you can .
or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world . we &apos;ll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world , who might inspire us .
and , in fact , there is a product called tpa that &apos;s mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein -- and it &apos;s an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes .
three questions , for me , are key .
it &apos;s twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics .
solar transformations : the most exciting one .
we do chemistry in organic solvents .
talk about foreplay , i -- we need to get to 12 , but really quickly .
janine , thank you so much .
and she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women .
if you see the word &quot; microfinance , &quot; what comes to mind ?
and kiva.org , the microlender , is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans .
this topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life .
once upon a time in 19th century germany , there was the book .
they realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they &apos;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting shakespeare on facebook walls .
screw the paper towels . let &apos;s go to a sponge .
now , spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks -- but it is pretty high embodied energy , and , sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that .
you might want to leave now .
and so i built the vending machine .
so keep in mind that she &apos;s never seen this done .
wait for the light to stop the traffic .
and eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
so i said , &quot; forget that . i &apos;m the new governor .
what policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way ?
you see , you &apos;ve got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation .
i &apos;m going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love , or love to hate , are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender .
they know this is the mass audience of the future ; they need to figure it out .
but i think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough -- responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the &quot; chick flick &quot; and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things -- that hispanics like certain things , that young people like certain things .
i &apos;m going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird molotov cocktails .
we are 12 billion light years from the edge .
i &apos;m going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in the journal of ultrasound in medicine .
you gotta love that . rutgers .
obviously it wouldn &apos;t be as much fun for the person .
it was called the &quot; upsuck &quot; theory .
there &apos;s another way that orgasm might boost fertility .
there is a point in this video , towards the beginning where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring , as if to say , &quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s just his job . he really does like women . &quot;
this is basically a penis camera on a motor .
he had just signed the contract to sell his new york apartment at a six-figure profit , and he &apos;d only owned it for five years .
now i know that seems ludicrous .
pull the knot .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day .
we are only happy when things are in order .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
and i started to bring some order into some flags .
he had a dixieland jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes .
and moms grab their kids out of the way and say , &quot; don &apos;t stare ! &quot;
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right ; i &apos;m no longer a victim .
it &apos;s as though intent is an essential component for humanity .
in fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive ?
i was in a wheelchair ; i didn &apos;t look like a looter .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
i didn &apos;t have an exact address , but i knew his name , abed , i knew that he lived in a town of 15,000 , kfar kara , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this holy city , he broke my neck .
but abed did not slow , and on that xeroxed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , i was left without anger .
were we instead our bodies , their inborn endowments and deficits ?
i stepped from my car and said &quot; shalom , &quot; and identified myself , and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours .
i had come for remorse .
&quot; well , &quot; he said , &quot; i once went 60 in a 40 . &quot;
if you are mindful of what you do not have , you may be truly mindful of what you do have , and if the gods are kind , you may truly enjoy what you have .
so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines , and not just sentience , but empathy .
so , we &apos;re involving two things .
it seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , i remember thinking , &quot; i have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because i knew i was going to huff and puff during this conversation .
the damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $ 15,000 .
it &apos;s what he &apos;s basically talking about in those 18 and a half minutes .
and finally also , i never understood this , some people really came up with their own version of the truth .
so i had 50 overall summaries done .
now this was revolutionary .
and the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
so if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to calculate these features , calculate the amount of dark energy .
and without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes .
you see , when we speak of the big bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
but because the expansion is speeding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won &apos;t be able to see them -- not because of technological limitations , but because of the laws of physics .
holy cow ! that &apos;s just amazing .
we had to give him a problem because when we first created milo , we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat , to be honest with you .
so dimitri &apos;s now going to use -- he &apos;s used his hand ; he &apos;s used his body .
deep .
and what we did was , we needed to give milo this big problem .
thanks .
she thinks she &apos;s dreaming , but she &apos;s not .
and when i first arrived in damascus , i saw this strange moment where people didn &apos;t seem to believe that war was going to descend , and it was exactly the same in bosnia and nearly every other country i &apos;ve seen where war comes .
and i called him luca , which means &quot; the bringer of light , &quot; because he does bring light to my life .
reporter janine di giovanni has been to the worst places on earth to bring back stories from bosnia , sierra leone and most recently syria . she tells stories of human moments within large conflicts -- and explores that shocking transition when a familiar city street becomes a bombed-out battleground .
and if she &apos;s doing that , because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor , she gets a drop of brazilian orange juice .
and what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world .
how far can we take it ?
the global challenge that i want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages .
we turned the money over to that man there , the principal of the school .
she &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
when you educate a girl , she tends to have significantly fewer kids .
and if you look at another factor , another contrast , a slave back then is worth about $ 40,000 in today &apos;s money .
she fought off the hyenas with that stick .
and when she couldn &apos;t produce enough , she hired other women in the village .
she stayed at the top of her class through elementary school , middle school , she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village , ever , to come to the united states on scholarship .
one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself .
and just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood , you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else &apos;s brain to suit your interests .
now this may sound arrogant , or even full of hubris .
in fact , we can even make the &quot; stuff of life &quot; -- as i just said , all the stuff around us .
just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit , language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit .
now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to , with social learning and language , we could transform the environment to suit our needs .
now we have to counter that , though , against the evidence we &apos;ve heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the neanderthals and the denisovans .
and you can probably think of many , many more in your own everyday lives .
they didn &apos;t want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities , myths and beliefs , and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth .
hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state , allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage .
this is a braille edition of playboy magazine .
it &apos;s a military operations on urbanized terrain site .
and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory , if there ever was an actual memory .
ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman .
this actually became my creative obsession .
and we found through this whole process , we found this great little manufacturer in virginia , and if his body language is any indication , that &apos;s the owner — — of what it &apos;s like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer , you &apos;ve got to see what happens here .
google earth goes from this view down to your backyard .
and just being able to visit different places and go through different times , we have data from 1950 to 2050 .
i &apos;m going to go back to today , now , and i want to show you where voyager 1 is .
these routes to happiness haven &apos;t really increased happiness very much .
cortisol floods the brain ; it destroys hippocampal cells and memory , and can lead to all kinds of health problems .
absent from this list , and absent from any discussions of happiness , are happiness in another &apos;s happiness .
dopamine system , the wanting system , is much more centralized .
and being alone is very unnatural to the human .
so clearly there is some effect .
cognitive researcher nancy etcoff looks at happiness -- the ways we try to achieve and increase it , the way it &apos;s untethered to our real circumstances , and its surprising effect on our bodies .
and the animal comes back for a food reward .
if the animal does that , it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs , by the way .
we &apos;re talking now explosives , tuberculosis , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
now , let &apos;s look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture .
well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched .
neuroscientist vilayanur ramachandran outlines the fascinating functions of mirror neurons . only recently discovered , these neurons allow us to learn complex social behaviors , some of which formed the foundations of human civilization as we know it .
if you actually didn &apos;t realize that plants have sex , they have rampant , promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex . really .
okay , so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects .
this is a horse chestnut .
heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
she had to impersonate a man .
well there was a little piece of that women &apos;s health initiative that went to national heart , lung , and blood institute , which is the cardiology part of the nih .
right here , it &apos;s just a focal -- right there .
and we &apos;re about two and a half years into a five-year study .
that &apos;s all stem cells .
but we cannot stop now .
we plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes .
let &apos;s see how powerful just one of these essentials can be .
tissue engineer and fellow nina tandon is growing artificial hearts and bones . to do that , she needs new ways of caring for artificially grown cells -- techniques she &apos;s developed by the simple but powerful method of copying their natural environments .
i &apos;d like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form .
that environment , people , are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now .
nanny : you want water ?
so we &apos;re pulling in about three billion comments a month , and then the magic happens .
we &apos;ve given this person a name .
my mother &apos;s in the kitchen , cooking , and , of all places , in the hallway , i realize he &apos;s about to do it , about to take more than two steps .
cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn &apos;t actually see the world as it is , but instead , creates a series of mental models through a collection of &quot; ah-ha moments , &quot; or moments of discovery , through various processes .
so what can we learn about this ? how can we apply this insight ?
there &apos;s always a room , always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan .
have a little turret there .
it looks a little phallic , but after all , it &apos;s a bathroom .
this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in america .
because that &apos;s what you do with a cracked pane .
i feature organic process .
and he was out there with his tape measure going through the trash heap , looking for header material , which is the board that goes over a door , thinking he &apos;d impress his boss -- that &apos;s how we taught him to do it .
the walls are this thick .
in there he talked about the divided self .
see , look , don &apos;t touch my designer jeans .
and your instinct is to say , &quot; why don &apos;t you suck an egg ? &quot;
and the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work have run across the wreckage , and they &apos;ve advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car , that the driver &apos;s dead , that i &apos;m dead .
and then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle .
half of e.r. admissions from adolescents are for concussions .
this is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three-dimensional function within the brain .
that &apos;s when i was discharged from the system .
and when i underwent it and found solutions , this is the interrelationship between the tmj and the teeth .
and in the following months and years , i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning .
in my coma , one of the presences i sensed was someone i felt was a protector .
simon lewis : i knew when i was timing this that there wouldn &apos;t be time for me to do anything about -- well this is it . this is the control unit .
because the first generation is exoskeletal , it &apos;s wrapped around the leg , around the affected limb .
we did this software which displays it like this : every bubble here is a country .
and in the &apos; 80s here , you have bangladesh still among the african countries there .
now i have money on that axis , and i have the possibility of children to survive there .
and if we move back again , here , and we put on trails on them , like this , you can see again that the speed of development is very , very different , and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health , but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first .
you can take a data set and put it there .
it takes some time to change for this , but on the axises , you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have .
and , you know , you understand life as it now exists through evolution .
so there was something universal about the dna molecule .
and we kept telling the people in london that linus pauling &apos;s going to move on to dna .
she was a crystallographer .
so think about it . the next five years , there were essentially something like five references to our work in &quot; nature &quot; -- none .
and so dna didn &apos;t become a useful molecule , and the lawyers didn &apos;t enter into the equation until 1973 , 20 years later , when boyer and cohen in san francisco and stanford came up with their method of recombinant dna , and stanford patented it and made a lot of money .
so a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of dna .
nobel laureate james watson opens ted2005 with the frank and funny story of how he and his research partner , francis crick , discovered the structure of dna .
with no employees .
well to sum up , it boils down to one thing : don &apos;t negotiate with terrorists .
these girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms .
so the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
i know that very well , because i was one of the lucky girls .
in this scene , people are living in an iron lung .
and in both cases , we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses , and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
it &apos;s been tried six times in the last century , and it &apos;s been successful exactly once .
it &apos;s just two drops , like that .
and then to make the matters even worse , the virus started to spread out of these four places , especially northern india and northern nigeria , into much of africa , asia , and even into europe , causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades .
polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- uttar pradesh and bihar -- 500,000 children every single month .
help us build the momentum so that very soon every child , every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever .
so good luck . we &apos;re all in this with you .
she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us , sat next to us , shivering , with her back towards dereck , and looking out .
but all the places we get stuck in really have great views .
this elephant , against overwhelming odds , simply gives up hope .
and of course , we knew now that she was going to survive .
and that &apos;s not the only leopards that were being killed through that period .
bj : so you have to know , looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now , it is all about critical awareness .
every time you drink a glass of water , he points out , the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of oliver cromwell .
as frightening as the prospect was , he was going into the next office .
steve grand points out that you and i are , ourselves , more like a wave than a permanent thing .
and the point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used , rather than by the sensory modality involved .
if life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe , that planet has to be our planet , because here we are talking about it .
or , finally , are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings , however godlike , could dream them ?
i can surf the web , exchange email with people , and routinely destroy my friend steve cousins in online word games .
one of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop .
henry evans and chad jenkins : meet the robots for humanity
we can also use cymatics for healing and education .
and we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen . thank you .
so i went onto twitter , and i asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; cala a boca , galvao . &quot;
so as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
we end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend eli pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
i think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
that &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
so this is a real problem -- not just because the red sox are having a bad year -- but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at ted , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
now the trick with this is that i &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak malagasy .
but if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
and specifically , it &apos;s looking at a blacksmith in kibera in nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a landrover into a cold chisel .
for a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
all of them , however , including myself , as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road , feel that we &apos;ve become less than the sum of our parts , feel as though we have become profoundly diminished .
most remote community , i have never met a villager who does not want a vote .
it &apos;s a question of what the citizens do .
you &apos;ve won a prize !
broccoli is not a chinese vegetable ; in fact , it is originally an italian vegetable .
you know , back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan : if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl , you could take her out on a chop suey date .
so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights .
so , this actually became very clear to me with the march 30 , 2005 powerball drawing , where , you know , they expected , based on the number of ticket sales they had , to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six powerball numbers .
and the great innovation of chicken mcnuggets was not nuggetfying them , because that &apos;s kind of an easy concept , but the trick behind chicken mcnuggets was , they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner , which is why it took so long for other people to copy them .
but it wasn &apos;t enough to use the priests .
he said , &quot; this fellow &quot; -- remember , he wasn &apos;t even put to sleep -- &quot; after this major grand mal convulsion , sat right up , looked at these three fellas and said , &apos; what the fuck are you assholes trying to do ? &apos; &quot; if i could only say that in italian .
i was , in the 1960s , in a marriage . to use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year .
i rarely bathed . i sometimes didn &apos;t shave . it was dreadful .
you &apos;ve just seen him from time to time . you &apos;ve read reports and so forth .
much better than &quot; basingstoke , &quot; at least for me . and it worked -- my god , it worked .
i &apos;ve always felt that somehow i was an impostor because my readers don &apos;t know what i have just told you .
but we don &apos;t necessarily have the means to do so .
and then someone says , &quot; how should i know ? i come from alabama . &quot;
and when the world starts to work together , with better early warning systems , then you can deal with some of these problems in a far better way .
all these things have happened .
yes . and then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests .
and then the story is that barroso , the president of the european commission , &quot; when will we get a recovery of global growth ? &quot;
so this material is silk .
so let me see .
i mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?
fiorenzo omenetto : silk , the ancient material of the future
some of you in this middle section -- you have red / green paddles .
you get past me , the guy behind me has a spoon . &quot;
thank you .
the question is , what can i do with you ?
what if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships ?
let me introduce him .
then he said , &quot; but really , sarah , you could have worked harder ! can &apos;t you see it &apos;s really too small ? &quot;
the whole family came to settle in france in the &apos; 30s .
now , of course , the man was very impressed with this young man of 17 who could immediately give him the formula , so he recruited him .
of course , there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that i understood much later .
then there was the vietnam war .
sarah kaminsky tells the extraordinary story of her father adolfo and his activity during world war ii -- using his ingenuity and talent for forgery to save lives . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet , a resilient planet , but unfortunately , the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .
in my mind , the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation .
now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries .
under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime .
the key though in all of these , the red thread , is the shift in mindset , moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead backcast our future , and we say , &quot; what is the playing field on the planet ?
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
but i wasn &apos;t into selling whiskey ; i was into selling ice .
&quot; the snail . &quot;
this is &quot; 6,500 yards , &quot; after corot . &quot; 9,000 yards , &quot; after gerhard richter .
they do a dna scan of this , they will come up with a great mailing list .
a hanger .
and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
and later , between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to colonize the rest of the world .
there is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worthwhile to consider , and that is that , in a very literal sense , they &apos;re really on the surface of our bodies .
statistically speaking , there is no difference in how often the neanderthal matches one african or the other .
they meet neanderthals , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in southeast asia , they meet denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
so sustainability is quite important for us , which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values .
so let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf .
these are survival skills .
and this is not something that happens to humans only .
the societal cost of this condition is huge .
and so in the past many years we &apos;ve been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking .
and using these kinds of measures , and many others , what we found out is that our science could , in fact , identify this condition early on .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early .
and at that point , you think , &quot; hey , guess what ?
so you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful ; they didn &apos;t lie , cheat , steal or abandon their comrades .
a 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
and yet , we need to have that shared sense .
you may know one line of it , it says , &quot; i &apos;ll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy . &quot;
the brilliant playwright , adrienne kennedy , wrote a volume called &quot; people who led to my plays . &quot;
i always say harlem is an interesting community because , unlike many other places , it thinks of itself in the past , present and the future simultaneously ; no one speaks of it just in the now .
this new set of questions is : what does it mean , right now , to be african-american in america ?
thelma golden : how art gives shape to cultural change
so i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ll leave it here for two months .
if you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away , then they will show off with each other about what they can do .
i said , &quot; well , did you look at any of the stuff ? &quot;
i said , &quot; well , what you &apos;ve got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time .
i &apos;ll come back after two months .
you know , stuff which i don &apos;t know anything about .
it &apos;s pitagora . &quot;
i want to go back to indonesia where i was about 21 , 22 years , a long time ago , on a fellowship .
and it &apos;s this incredible balance that i think that we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground , that &apos;s trying to do something you &apos;ve never seen before , that imaginary world where you actually don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going to end up , that &apos;s the fine line on the edge of a crater that i have walked my whole life .
and as it rises with the strings , i see that it &apos;s a sun .
stephano : out of the moon , i do assure thee .
the masked actors , the puppeteers , they disappear , and the audience makes that leap into this world , into this imaginary world of &quot; the tempest &quot; actually happening .
and we climbed up and we got to the very top , and we &apos;re on the edge , on this precipice , roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end , and i &apos;m up there alone on this incredible precipice .
i think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well , so i moved to kenya and worked in uganda , and i met a group of rwandan women , who asked me , in 1986 , to move to kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there .
and at the end of it , we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done , and i said , &quot; it is so beautiful . &quot;
i want to tell you two stories . both of them are in africa .
so he moved back to the farm , and , long story short , they now have seven acres under cultivation .
and so , anuj and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that , look , in a country like tanzania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
and my wish , when i see those women , i meet those farmers , and i think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day , is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility , and that they also can believe and get access to services , so that their children , too , can live those lives of great purpose .
now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption , an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task .
and as if that wasn &apos;t enough , all of these incredibly complicating things , right , they wanted it in one shot .
and so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
we need some more ridiculous things besides &quot; the cabinet of natural curiosities . &quot;
but also , technology has helped to write new pages of our history , or at least to update pages of our histories .
art history is far from set in stone . engineer maurizio seracini spent 30 years searching for leonardo da vinci &apos;s lost fresco &quot; the battle of anghiari , &quot; and in the process discovered that many paintings have layers of history hidden underneath . should they be part of the viewing experience too ?
so we can make a model of your heart , your brain on a chip .
and some of our colleagues at tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next , and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies .
good business in obstetricians , morticians , and farming , housing , etc . -- they all deal with human bodies , which require being fed , transported , housed and so on . and the information technology , which connects to our brains , has no limit -- now , that is a wonderful field to be in . you &apos;re looking for growth opportunity ?
some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent .
pm : but now we &apos;re trying to get the video . there we go .
you can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along . as you get to these small scales , you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature &apos;s realm , nature has 200 million years of experience .
and when it comes down -- and we &apos;ll see how it goes .
so some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical , and after a while , someone made a particularly silly suggestion and ms. russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism , &quot; that wouldn &apos;t work .
one is not prime .
this is the great swiss mathematician leonhard euler .
it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format -- and for the rest of the hour of his talk frank nelson cole busted that out .
i shivered -- -- contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room , and said &quot; girls , hold the front page .
it &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
it might have been a politician . it might have been a breakthrough .
but not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the tasmanian devil , and it &apos;s the world &apos;s largest carnivorous marsupial .
her body was riddled with secondary tumors .
but that is where the tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation .
so this tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer .
and this is a photograph of dr. southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer , who in this case was an inmate in ohio state penitentiary .
that means that out of five married couples , two will end up splitting their assets .
okay , now do the same for your driving ability .
when they failed , it wasn &apos;t because they were dumb , but because the exam just happened to be unfair .
and that anticipation enhances their wellbeing .
what we wanted to know was whether people will take the information that we gave them to change their beliefs .
the more optimistic you were , the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information .
the british government , for example , has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects .
and there the simple version of the message is it &apos;s moving from west to east .
and what that means is not that the age of the state is over .
and we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective .
history is not linear .
many people argue that the 21st century is going to repeat the 20th century , in which world war one , the great conflagration in which the european state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world , that that was caused by and the fear it created in britain .
another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21st century , we want to get away from the idea that power &apos;s always zero sum -- my gain is your loss and vice versa .
joseph nye : global power shifts
what an election produces is a winner and a loser .
typically in the past , the donors have been interested in the first couple of years , and then they got bored .
it would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where , when we got to a post-conflict situation , there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties .
that is not a good idea .
lets develop line ministries of this , that , and the other , that deliver these services .
it &apos;s captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem .
other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways .
their march electricity bill was only 48 dollars .
third , adapting to rising seas .
&quot; stationarity &quot; is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past , and plan accordingly , and this principle governs much of our engineering , our design of critical infrastructure , city water systems , building codes , even water rights and other legal precedents .
t : i don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
s : i want to speak perfect english .
that is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on i.q. tests .
he found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical , to speculating about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions .
what color are the bears at the north pole ? &quot;
and so forth .
but i &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
that &apos;s not one of the principles i &apos;ve got .
by 2010 , college graduates , if you said two circles followed by a semicircle , two sixteens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 .
i called my wife leslie , and i said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
i said , &quot; what is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; a job . &quot;
he proposed the film to me , and i said , &quot; yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local tv , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot;
and my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in virginia , who was my inspiration .
they have different assets , commercial and military .
i &apos;m just a clarifier . i &apos;m just a facilitator .
without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her prime minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
you have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
but it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
i didn &apos;t know what they were doing . i &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
the early &apos; 70s , i was in college .
it was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people , just once in a week , they put in all the vats .
because triangles are the only rigid structures .
and every time i go to a school , i see a gleam in the eyes of the children .
this is a toy which is made from paper . it &apos;s amazing .
and this is what newton talked about 400 years back , that white light &apos;s made of seven colors , just by spinning this around .
over 100,000 children learn science this way .
there are 12 million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness .
all of our old newspapers , we cut them into little squares .
a huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down .
and thirdly , changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy .
and actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions .
and the kind of elements i &apos;m talking about are , firstly , we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse , a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas .
and those bumps are hydrophilic ; they attract water .
that &apos;s exactly what the seawater greenhouse produces .
now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine .
now as it turns out , i &apos;m somebody who thinks a lot about data , as you &apos;ll soon find .
what &apos;s the rabbi going to say ?
but then steve the i.t. guy didn &apos;t come back .
what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate ?
who are all of the other women on these dating sites ?
so in my case , you know , &quot; the english patient &quot; is my most favorite movie ever , but it doesn &apos;t work to use that in a profile , because that &apos;s a superficial data point , and somebody may disagree with me and decide they don &apos;t want to go out with me because they didn &apos;t like sitting through the three-hour movie .
he looked and talked exactly like what i wanted , and immediately , he scored 850 points .
it is clearly here to stay . it has an amazing impact on our everyday life . consider these statistics released by activision . after one month of release of the game &quot; call of duty : black ops , &quot; it had been played for 68,000 years worldwide , right ?
it &apos;s better than those that don &apos;t play .
this is something we use all the time . when you &apos;re driving , you &apos;re tracking , keeping track of the cars around you .
they switch really fast , very swiftly . they pay a very small cost .
most of the kids don &apos;t go to school saying , &quot; great , two hours of math ! &quot;
i &apos;d like to leave you with that thought , and thank you for your attention .
try changing it again .
it doesn &apos;t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation ; just something that happens , naturally , things with rules as simple as these can do it .
the idea is that we can just type this in , this kind of question in , however we think of it .
and if you look at things like the iphone app , the fraction is considerably larger .
i mean , anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language .
if the rules for the universe are simple , it &apos;s kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level ; operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things .
thank you .
we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease .
for each patient , we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient .
i went to school not because the maasais &apos; women or girls were going to school .
once i go through this tradition , i was going to become a wife .
it &apos;s practiced , it &apos;s no anesthesia , it &apos;s a rusty old knife , and it was difficult .
but i needed the support of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school , they said , &quot; what a lost opportunity .
i learned that my mom had a right to own property .
and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline .
we are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your community , you are going to change your country , and think about that . if you do that , and i do that , aren &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grandchildren ?
this is something i call the 50-20 paradox .
visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they &apos;re using credit cards .
we found a couple of really interesting things .
so it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups , to the weather , to the team records , in setting prices for the consumer .
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees , to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .
patagonia &apos;s footprint chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make , and gives you social responsibility , and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make .
and then there is this other really interesting movement that &apos;s happened in california , which is about carrot mobs .
so , when we look at this and we step back , what i believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real .
i know a gentleman , married for 25 years , who &apos;s longing to hear his wife say , &quot; thank you for being the breadwinner , so i can stay home with the kids , &quot; but won &apos;t ask .
what do you need to hear ? go home to your wife -- go ask her , what does she need ?
our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so i grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
and it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , east and west alike .
and i should know , because during the time i attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope , and turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; eurovision song contest .
so i feel connected to each language in a different way .
we often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the turkish-armenian conflict .
if it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
but i think these aren &apos;t just the components of remixing .
now , creative works may indeed be kind of like property , but it &apos;s property that we &apos;re all building on , and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared .
i &apos;m only exaggerating a little bit . it &apos;s a broad patent .
our creativity comes from without , not from within .
and you say then , &quot; ok , then how do you know your home address ? &quot;
but i think to set the scene , i want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted , but it is a bit of a mess .
what &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
we think it &apos;s saltwater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined .
see , back in the 1880s , 1890s , many scientists , many observers , looked at the light given off from atoms .
you can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a telescope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the sun .
this is a beautiful quote that i found -- we &apos;re talking about serendipity there -- from alexander fleming : &quot; when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 , 1928 , i certainly didn &apos;t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world &apos;s first antibiotic . &quot;
and it took this picture of earth .
i don &apos;t know why , but i &apos;m continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world &apos;s population can go online to learn , to create and to share .
all of them are connected , as you can see , to form a picture of me on the web .
at the same time i installed my own collusion profile , i installed one for my daughter .
and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
and so i argued with people about that , i argued and i argued .
so for a year i said i would keep quiet , and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again .
and i said -- rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , south america .
and so i went on .
20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; john , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
i don &apos;t need to show you my passport . it &apos;s in the back of my pack .
and we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we &apos;ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
in the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to china to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
i realized i couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
but nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
my foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in america .
i will live my life happily and study hard until i see you , and i promise i will not cry again .
my goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
we can make it better .
i made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , i used beer crates as a foundation .
in 2009 , in italy , l &apos;aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
now i am working in new zealand , christchurch .
now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me .
it even makes its cries sound like the mother &apos;s language , which may further endear the baby to the mother , and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language .
will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
it seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly .
the notion that the prenatal transmission of ptsd risk is adaptive is still speculative , but i find it rather poignant .
is just an artful demonstration of dexterity .
but when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected , we laugh .
marco tempest : a magical tale
you may remember this as the aol-time warner merger , okay , heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time .
but secondly , to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated .
but the small stuff , what you might call the user interface , is done spectacularly badly .
it &apos;s a kind of mechanistic world that we &apos;d all love to live in where , effectively , it sits very nicely on spreadsheets , everything is numerically expressible , and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success .
the people who actually have no money , who have no extravagant budget , but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay , but you &apos;ll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible english .
but it sort of creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny , tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology .
thank you .
and i felt overwhelmed .
and i think the way that we go through that sometimes can , first of all , disembody a group of people , individuals out there in the world .
and over and over again , as i interviewed them and spent my days with them , i did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change .
so this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family , and through that , maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans , that &apos;s this little idea that turned into kiva .
maybe they &apos;re smiling , and they want to talk to you about what they &apos;ve done .
with social networks , it &apos;s an amazing way , growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities , rapidly .
what we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use kiva to make those connections .
is there alien life out there ?
maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence .
our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain lurking on planet earth , but to spread out into space .
a couple of examples .
hello , come in , earth .
we know how big the haystack is . it &apos;s the galaxy .
i happen to know what the consequence for me would be , because we &apos;ve had false alarms . this is 1997 , and this is a photo i made at about 3 o &apos;clock in the morning in mountain view here , when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought , &quot; this is the real deal . &quot; all right ?
that &apos;s interesting to cosmologists .
now , that &apos;s not true anymore .
and he gave some talk . all i remember from it was one word : electronics .
i have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years .
i think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry .
i would say , &quot; no , that &apos;s an elephant . &quot;
but in addition , if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little george bush here , you see that you have vertical forehead .
that &apos;s why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth -- faster than us , anyway .
can you imagine how much biased his report would be ?
it &apos;s a place of myth and legend .
and of course , if you want people to play by the rules , you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement , for as we &apos;ve discovered , you can trust , but you also need to verify .
spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now : the ross sea in the southern ocean .
but what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the eastern tropical pacific seascape .
it does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate , if you &apos;re going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources , we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you &apos;re doing .
so i get off the plane , and i come to ted .
now it &apos;s not always easy to push yourself , and that &apos;s why they invented mothers .
he said , &quot; here it is . i &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
i think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content -- the tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts -- that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
they &apos;ve taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun .
and then he goes back to his quarters , breaks down and weeps because he &apos;s convinced that the situation is hopeless .
so it &apos;ll show you gdp per capita , population , longevity , that &apos;s about it .
the complexity here is unbelievable .
so let &apos;s say you wanted to make detergent .
you see how this works , right ?
you think it &apos;s obvious ?
they knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients , and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment .
cochrane understood that uncertainty , that fallibility , that being challenged , they hurt .
it &apos;s full of us , it &apos;s full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our demands .
come on , you &apos;re thinking .
it certainly is .
i know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
perhaps denial .
there &apos;s certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way .
the earth can support that if we choose the right path .
that means for every dollar you deposit , it loans out about nine or 10 .
and here &apos;s his second bit of advice .
sixty-eight is young today .
so let &apos;s bring a romance novelist into this conversation .
so you take resveratrol and you put it into beer .
she &apos;s now running around with her kids .
o.k. , so let me remind you , a turing test is where you &apos;ve got a wall , you &apos;re talking to somebody on the other side of the wall , and when you don &apos;t know if that thing is human or animal -- that &apos;s when computers have reached human intelligence .
and , of course , the future is looking back 200 years , because next week is the 200th anniversary of darwin &apos;s birth .
and along came a brilliant inventor , a scientist , who came up with a partial cure for that disease .
and he thought about it , and the expensive one didn &apos;t seem that great to him . so he thought , &quot; i don &apos;t know anything about science , but i do know something about data , so maybe i should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one . &quot;
so the highest bar is what you &apos;re striving to beat .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s a great idea . &quot;
so this car seat was actually an above-average car seat from consumer reports , and did quite well .
it &apos;s just actually -- you see , this is folding up -- it &apos;s behind the seat .
in the new jersey data , which is different , because it &apos;s not just fatal crashes , but all crashes in new jersey that are reported , it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries , but generally they &apos;re the minor injuries .
it &apos;s impossible in theory , but possible in practice .
that &apos;s a lot of storage , memory . nine exabyte ram .
and so in some ways , all you really need is a cloudbook .
and so one of the consequences of that , i believe , is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now -- tv , film , video -- that basically becomes one media platform .
so you were forwarding on . you didn &apos;t have control .
there &apos;s like a billion social sites on the web .
and we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot;
we &apos;ll have a better word for it .
i started going out on cases .
the thing i had to admit to myself , with great repulsion , was that i get it .
but it &apos;s a human problem . it &apos;s a scientific problem , if you will .
and those things are the reflection of the processes , and the time that they are made .
and the project -- again , enormous , enormous competition -- on the hudson river and in new york that we were asked to do three years ago , which uses these processes .
it has a material identity and it &apos;s translucent and it &apos;s porous , and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is .
this will be the first building in the united states that took -- well , i can &apos;t say it took the air conditioning out . it &apos;s a hybrid .
and there it is , again , as it &apos;s starting to get resolved tectonically , and then there &apos;s the school .
and then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic , the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts , geologic shifts . right ?
thom mayne : how architecture can connect us
no , no , no , no . better -- to live of cooked food .
now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula .
reward : this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements -- the external states , our internal states , how do we feel , and so on are put together .
and now this brain takes care over this , to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and , of course , digest our food we cook .
despite generating a healthy hunger signal , the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut .
if we add the matrix , if we add the structure language , which we have to learn , when we learn it , then we can put it back ; and around energy , we could generate a balance , which comes out from our really primordial operation : cooking .
we are all cut from the same genetic cloth .
our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear .
climb again over the course of 24 hours .
now , when i was here at the first ted , i showed this photograph : two men of the elder brothers , the descendants , survivors of el dorado .
i traveled with the arhuacos , and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man , danilo villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second .
we were able to , because we had trained people in filmmaking , continue with our work , and send our wiwa and arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film , and we followed the rest of the arhuaco back to the sea , taking the elements from the highlands to the sea .
they are unique answers to that fundamental question : what does it mean to be human and alive ?
even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment -- on the side of the road or next to a river .
because in nature , mushrooms are the recycling system .
it &apos;ll actually begin to digest these wastes and , over the next five days , assemble them into biocomposites .
biological yield is really important .
and the atoms themselves are quite violent , but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency , an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down .
now surprisingly , it seems to work .
our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me .
and she was thinking about the work i did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience doesn &apos;t like head-tail-tail -- they think , for deep cultural reasons , that &apos;s boring -- and they &apos;re much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-head .
there are two ways of thinking about this .
when you toss a coin , you get a sequence of heads and tails .
we don &apos;t know what causes them .
well , amongst the 100 who do have the disease , the test will get it right 99 percent of the time , and 99 will test positive .
so where did he get the one in 73 million number ?
we want to know how likely , or relatively how likely , two different explanations are .
we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .
thanks very much .
the appliance &apos;s safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug .
you can &apos;t just tell a one sided story .
so even though china &apos;s is a totally censored internet , but still , chinese internet society is really booming .
but those two very smart international censorship policies didn &apos;t prevent chinese social media &#91; from &#93; becoming a really public sphere , a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of chinese officials .
you can almost have all the journalistic elements there .
one of them is yao chen , she is the most popular microblogger in china , who has about 21 million followers .
but i want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat-and-mouse .
they just give them a target window to not censor people .
this is what we want out of our senses .
mother : that &apos;s an owl .
john niparko : so you &apos;ve written two books ?
language is very different . language is very precise .
but it certainly wasn &apos;t the way the music was intended .
now the question comes to mind : is there any hope ?
joseph : i was born in 1986 .
you wouldn &apos;t want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
for you , and you heard already , being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy .
the story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the dutch armed forces at the beginning of the second world war .
i took up the gun -- not to shoot , not to kill , not to destroy , but to stop those who would do evil , to protect the vulnerable , to defend democratic values , to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place .
abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war .
until that day comes , i stand for my father who tried to shoot the nazis with an old gun .
this is a computer program made of zeros and ones .
you can look with a microscope and see them on a surface .
so momentum is good . don &apos;t stop .
you &apos;re focusing on the consequences of failing at what you &apos;re doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively .
nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it &apos;s needed .
the genome project was a controversial project in 1990 .
we always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we might as well use the third dimension .
but what we &apos;re actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it .
it &apos;s now under a 10th of a cent .
there are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices ; there are many experiments in animals .
by 2010 computers will disappear .
if you really look at the power of exponential growth , you &apos;ll see that these things are pretty soon at hand .
i want to believe , and you do too .
is it a dangerous predator , or is it just the wind ?
and what do you see here ?
a similar experiment was done by another &#91; swiss &#93; psychologist named peter brugger , who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere , via the left visual field , than the left hemisphere .
just right , you &apos;re creative , and yet you don &apos;t fall for too much baloney .
that &apos;s a dolphin tail there , guys .
a fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with margaret thatcher .
was jfk assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin ?
you can use -- which i did , went out and did -- michael persinger &apos;s god helmet , that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves .
okay .
i forget the name of the of the army -- it &apos;s lord &apos;s resistance army , i believe -- but the government , also , doesn &apos;t have a clean sheet , so if we could run the first video .
in my country , it was -- we had been looking at pictures of british soldiers beating up young iraqis ; we &apos;ve got abu ghraib ; we &apos;ve got guantanamo bay .
and it seems appropriate to start at the end , because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals , but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living , and so dung beetles eat dung , and their larvae are also dung-feeders .
so our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
and see what his response is .
so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow , and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face , and all the time it &apos;s trying to cool itself down , we think , and avoid the hot sand that it &apos;s walking across .
if it is using something called path integration , it will not find its home . it will arrive at the wrong spot , and what it &apos;s doing here if it &apos;s using path integration is it &apos;s counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction .
a dung beetle has a brain the size of a grain of rice , and yet shows a tremendous amount of intelligence when it comes to rolling its food source -- animal excrement -- home . how ? it all comes down to a dance . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so if we were to render these sounds visually , we might end up with something like this .
there &apos;s no closed captioning for the ted theme song , and we &apos;re missing it , but if you &apos;ve watched enough of these , you hear it in your mind &apos;s ear , and then applause starts .
he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest , more than 30 years before edmund hillary .
and that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
but scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
david s. rose : people ? you ! that &apos;s it -- you are the person .
because even if you didn &apos;t do it right the first time , you &apos;ve learned the lessons , which are going to stand you in very good stead the next time .
because bad things happen .
but you &apos;ve got to grab their emotional attention , focused on you , within that first few seconds .
on the other hand , there are a lot of things that drive me down , take the emotional level down , and you &apos;ve got to recover from those .
what are you focusing on ?
i look at the logo , and it sort of ties it to my brain .
but then , everybody has competition .
and then finally , having done all that , you &apos;ve now told me the whole thing , so now you &apos;ve got to bring it back to that conclusion .
always use remote control .
so i immediately decided , this is going to be the name of the game , or my new exclamation .
now i clicked on this on purpose , but if i &apos;d somehow gotten here by mistake , it does remind me , for the band , see &quot; the beatles , &quot; for the car see &quot; volkswagon beetle , &quot; but i am here for beetle beetles .
i do like sympathy . i do like magic .
when i click on yuri gagarin &apos;s page , i get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature , huge in heroism .
now why , steve , why do we need a revolution ?
so it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
to be serious .
true story : i went looking for a school for my kid .
it can &apos;t be because of play .
dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
these are the benefits to play .
it increases our openness to change .
there &apos;s nothing weird about bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
so in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
but , of course , i &apos;m working since 25 , doing more or less what you see here . this is castleton china .
this is not that they took me -- the work didn &apos;t take me -- i made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world .
the director there said there were several women casting and producing my designs now in molds , and this was sold also to america .
the accusation was that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin &apos;s life .
that &apos;s my camera lens . the first one -- the one i shot my bob dylan film with 35 years ago .
so i started to say , &quot; hey , man , you are too much !
rg : you may remember , we fell head over heels in love .
rg : so today , what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos .
we have charted our love for our child over time .
i felt incredibly connected to the community around me .
and it was obviously a very difficult time -- really painful .
basically , there &apos;s this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction , which is closely aligned , we all know , with broader happiness , that doesn &apos;t rise again until your first child goes to college .
rg : and so in effect , we trade average happiness .
rufus griscom + alisa volkman : let &apos;s talk parenting taboos
he died 25 years ago this year , and was born 75 years ago this year .
lots of you can afford to buy one of these .
i get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there .
every time i listen to that , i get goose bumps .
it &apos;s hard to believe that it &apos;s less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance , the credit , which drives our economies froze .
and ever since then , i &apos;ve wondered why it is that capitalism is so amazingly efficient at some things , but so inefficient at others , why it &apos;s so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others .
and everywhere too , you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies , people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market -- people , buildings , land -- and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs .
and here &apos;s the problem .
across northern europe , many governments now have innovation laboratories within them .
i &apos;m not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost , though that might be quite tempting .
now that we see these huge differences in savings rates , how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences ?
they can say , &quot; yesterday it rain , &quot; &quot; now it rain , &quot; &quot; tomorrow it rain . &quot;
just to give you a hint of that , let &apos;s look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about .
what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages .
it &apos;s almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn &apos;t present .
could there be a connection ?
now let me put it this way : if i met a monolingual dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer , would i stop him from entering my british university ?
this system equates intelligence with a knowledge of english , which is quite arbitrary .
if you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
and then , navy pilot training , and , after college , i got into sailplane flying , power plane flying , and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun , but got tangled up with some great professor types , who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science .
i thought back about if i was a space traveler , and came and visited earth every 5,000 years .
we &apos;re in charge . it &apos;s frightening .
in effect a pair of roving eyeglasses , a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle .
and so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current .
compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute , most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others , even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings .
another three years , no vision . he leaves again .
so , he had a brilliant idea .
and so he took the maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe , a ball -- took him on his shoulder .
and also , actually , i &apos;ve been your mother .
and this is the way you do it . you take any being who looks weird to you , and you see how they could be familiar to you .
they would be relaxing somewhere having a good time .
and in buddhism , they catch it in the future life .
all of you know about the topic that i &apos;m supposed to talk about .
and here i &apos;ve corrupted the potter stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something -- which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone , internet and birth control pills -- by saying that they &apos;re simple , the functions are simple , and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it .
and there &apos;s a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence , not so much in thinking about simplicity .
now , imagine building that up to a city , or to a society , and you &apos;ve got , obviously , an interesting problem .
so the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the internet .
you can build cathedrals out of stones , you just have to know what it does .
and , since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an 18 year-old with an ak-47 , who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing , he can take a picture of it with his cellphone , send the picture back to where there is a doctor , and the doctor can look at it .
gw : well , no .
it &apos;s when the internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable ; they &apos;ve got the incentive to innovate ; they &apos;ve got the tools ; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration .
all of our patents , our entire approach to patents and invention , is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for ; we can say what it &apos;s for .
largely through globalization , a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper .
meant to be a way to incentivize invention , meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge , they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place .
what you &apos;ll see , i think , is two things that are critical , and these , i think , are two challenges for the open movement .
because basically , he doesn &apos;t service them .
do you see ?
and i figured i &apos;d put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you &apos;re going through on your job .
and i said , &quot; if you put it all on this , i &apos;m going to deliver it to him , if you can figure out who this person is , &quot; because all i had was his name -- ray -- and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset .
and i promise you , if you take that walk inside google streetview , you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face .
you can look at it online .
so one of them was fairly straightforward .
and she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety .
when i get the brains i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m looking at .
but if you have this gene , in utero your brain is bathed in this , so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin , so it doesn &apos;t work later on in life .
and here is this &quot; killed strangely , &quot; and it &apos;s this historical book .
this is the large hadron collider .
well , particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious .
but you don &apos;t feel them , because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you .
but there &apos;s a problem .
now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these higgs particles .
but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the big bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy . the model wasn &apos;t built to do that , but it seems to do it .
on at least one , and maybe only one of those planets , primitive life evolved , which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of tanzania , and eventually left a footprint on another world .
in another yearbook , i stumbled upon barry obama &apos;s picture .
in addition to theorizing on evolution in &quot; the origin of species , &quot; charles darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory .
but this use of colors was not just an artistic act .
but to the second question , half of them that didn &apos;t like it , they wanted it to continue .
the reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole , and , on the other hand , a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe .
it &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
haiti was something we hadn &apos;t seen before .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence .
they also have their own news network on youtube with 36,000 viewers at the moment .
we need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question , &quot; what would amazon or google do with all of this data ? &quot;
i &apos;m a novelist , and i &apos;m interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common .
we need time &apos;s arrow to understand cause and effect , not just in the material world , but in our own intentions and our motivations .
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
it cannot be stored .
my search is always to find ways to chronicle , to share and to document stories about people , just everyday people .
and then we went to a fish restaurant , and we had chad , the surfer dude , serving us , and he came up and my mother said , &quot; do you have any specials , young man ? &quot;
and she told this woman .
which sort of made me feel good , because he &apos;d seen a lot of things .
i &apos;m sure he thought i &apos;d take a book or a shirt , but i found an inflatable sheep .
the igbo used to say that they built their own gods .
chris abani tells stories of people : people standing up to soldiers . people being compassionate . people being human and reclaiming their humanity . it &apos;s &quot; ubuntu , &quot; he says : the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me .
so almost all life on earth is wiped out about five times .
well svante paabo has the answer .
why would that matter ?
and as you think of that , what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells .
here &apos;s what it looks like in 2000 .
or maybe it &apos;s chemicals .
it consumes about 15 watts of power .
at the bottom right you see a robot performing a 360 degree flip in less than half a second .
and so what the robot does is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory .
so i want to show you a clip of aphaenogaster desert ants in professor stephen pratt &apos;s lab carrying an object .
so again , these robots come really close together .
so the robot then figures out what the features are .
this man is wearing what we call a bee beard .
the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it , but that &apos;s a basic overview of how pollination works .
with the trains coming in to urban hubs , they can carry pollen with them , very light pollen , and it &apos;s just a big supermarket in the city .
humans think about our own health in a prospective way .
we have also some images of honey from brooklyn .
unless you &apos;re on one of these californian low-carb diets , bread is standard .
in the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved , most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production .
so what is happening ?
bread has migrated to tropical countries , where the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava .
but this is a fallacy .
we need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we &apos;ve had .
and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale .
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .
and that , i think , evolutionarily-speaking is unique .
and that moment of inspiration , that key invention moment , was when i was sitting in front of my design notebook and i started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever , and if they grab near the end of the lever , they can get an effectively long lever and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth , and effectively get a low gear .
you can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers and talk with them face-to-face and leverage their local knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients and combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge to create something greater than either of us could have done alone .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures .
and they didn &apos;t kill it . they called us to catch it .
and now the king cobra is a new one .
i mean , just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again .
and , you know , once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
so , people talk about political will .
rw : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing .
you know , when most people think about the diet i recommend , they think it &apos;s a really strict diet .
it &apos;s important , but not enough .
it &apos;s not so much psychological , it &apos;s vascular , and nicotine makes your arteries constrict .
the other way is to change the type of food .
you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it .
and sure enough , we found a dose-response relationship , just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies .
the word yoga comes from the sanskrit , meaning &quot; union , to yoke , to bring together . &quot;
girl : are you sick ?
david is fearless of technology , and he is absolutely tenacious .
we basically put something together to get through the meeting .
not all at the same time -- but he had to , you know , do all of those things .
that we &apos;d written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one .
from there , we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face .
so while all that &apos;s going on , we &apos;re down in new orleans and locations around the world .
the next section here , i &apos;m going to just blast through this , because we could do a whole tedtalk on the next several slides .
so , as things went through this process , fincher would always say , &quot; it sandblasts the edges off of the performance . &quot;
the couple are barely 18 years old .
then there was no looking back at all for us .
kartick satyanarayan : how we rescued the &quot; dancing &quot; bears &quot;
and as we started to go through the desert , the jeep broke down .
and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel .
the desert &apos;s extremely windy as well as being very cold .
we had these big things that i weigh the bison on , for instance .
and if this is a creature that was designed by committee , it &apos;s certainly been like no committee i &apos;ve ever been on .
i &apos;m able to lose 40 percent of my weight without dying .
rw : that &apos;s terrific . thank you .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea you might take with you .
very funny .
i wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house , because the mice might get into them and start a fire .
it &apos;s called &quot; to my favorite 17-year-old high school girl . &quot;
and i discovered there that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it .
so i started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
the second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he &apos;s not interested in the food .
but it shows the intelligence that the elephants have .
people who have problems with empathy , such as autistic children , they don &apos;t have yawn contagion .
and here you have the two color tokens .
and we did that originally with capuchin monkeys .
she gives a rock to us now , gets , again , cucumber .
so here &apos;s his first follower with a crucial role ; he &apos;s going to show everyone else how to follow .
that , yes , it was the shirtless guy who was first , and he &apos;ll get all the credit , but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader .
so this is what i looked like by the end .
i was inspired by the danish safety council .
and i finally have stabilized .
and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you &apos;re eating doritos .
cheese ? chocolate ? where did that come from ?
a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article .
my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published .
i am more excited than most people , as a neuroscientist , about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter .
in fact , this is exactly the kind of question we &apos;re faced with when we try to understand the indus valley civilization , which existed 4,000 years ago .
it &apos;s only about one inch by one inch in size -- pretty tiny .
i &apos;ve always been fascinated by the indus script ever since i read about it in a middle school textbook .
and furthermore , there &apos;s some signs that really prefer the end of texts , such as this jar-shaped sign , and this sign , in fact , happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script .
my students said that i should really seriously consider getting some protection .
can you write it using pictures ?
why should we care ?
and you may wonder , how do we know what these sounds are ?
so whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution , watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves .
there were pigeons roosting in the dish .
they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that .
who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings -- if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
i love that leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time , doing it by having a good time .
the human being is almost out of time .
and what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
then you have in zimbabwe the first election under robert mugabe a year ago .
climate change cannot be solved in one country , but has got to be solved by the world working together .
when you looked in her eyes , any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future , but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl &apos;s eyes and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment , i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv / aids fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations .
thank you .
what experiments would you run ?
journalists , this is off the record ; it &apos;s embargoed .
really simple , but beautiful .
now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots ?
so here &apos;s rhex with paddles , now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot .
so to our blueprint , we stick on some sticky pads .
this is an undergraduate volunteer -- we have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them -- that &apos;s actually just a red pen mark .
and here &apos;s cutkosky &apos;s and his amazing students &apos; design .
our vision , which works so well in air , all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic .
by contrast , the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch , each individual here has a radically different call .
well , in a place like sarasota , florida , the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes .
so blue whales and fin whales produce very low-frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges .
it &apos;s as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old-fashioned style before , and with no golden oldies stations .
up high , these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave .
it &apos;s an amazing shift , induced by humans over this large scale , in both time and space .
the shipping lanes have been moved .
the worldwide telescope takes the best images from the world &apos;s greatest telescopes on earth and in space , and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe .
well , our gaze fills the universe .
boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school .
i think it &apos;s excessive internet use in general , excessive video gaming , excessive new access to pornography .
the interface just kind of disappears .
but what &apos;s neat about that is , again , i showed you that two-finger gesture that allows you to zoom in really quickly . because you don &apos;t have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool , you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales , all at the same time .
firstly , because i &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to say it .
then we were victims of don porfirio .
but , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
two years ago , in galena city , chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , eric le barón .
when we thought masiosare was the strange enemy , and we sang , with a childlike heart , &quot; a soldier in each son . &quot;
emiliano salinas : a civil response to violence
if you figure out what up and down really are , it &apos;s a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything , but then you add in sideways .
so , complexity . now , how many here are jugglers ?
pink .
so what i want you to do is -- fingers .
what i &apos;ve done for you here , i developed a lot of those tricks and i put the choreography together , but they &apos;re not original techniques .
thanks . the only thing i &apos;ll say about the last session is , you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour ?
i &apos;m actually leading up to something , the newest thing that i &apos;m working on . this is not it .
and it &apos;s going to change as i go through it .
lots of lives are being saved by those .
the last time i went to see this store , there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering , &quot; am i going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here ? &quot;
so we thought , well , wouldn &apos;t it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better ?
it &apos;s called spyfish , and it &apos;s a company called h2eye , started by nigel jagger in london .
what they do now is : they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can &apos;t grow them in the off-season .
in fact , if you look really closely at stuff , if you look at the basic substructure of matter , there isn &apos;t anything there .
for what it &apos;s worth , sir isaac newton , the greatest scientist who ever lived , he thought jesus came to earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity .
this is extraordinary . because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
what are we ? what is this thing that we hang on , that is actually us ?
heinrich hertz , when he discovered radio waves in 1887 , he called them radio waves because they radiated .
so we assembled a team of experts , spanning harvard , mit , the american heritage dictionary , the encyclopedia britannica and even our proud sponsors , the google .
now if those books are not lost to history , then they are somewhere in a library , and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by google , which has scanned 15 million books to date .
what do they tell us ?
in 1700 , in 1800 , in 1900 , no one cared .
one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician .
but much more importantly , the distribution is much wider .
this person was interested in the history of frustration .
so in a cocktail party like this , if i say , &quot; david , sara , pay attention , &quot; some of you just sat up .
first of all , we invented ways of recording -- first writing , then audio recording and now video recording as well .
second , i call this the mixer .
these are just some of the listening positions , or scales of listening positions , that you can use .
i painted myself white one day , stood on a box , put a hat or a can at my feet , and when someone came by and dropped in money , i handed them a flower and some intense eye contact .
and a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe i was in , and i bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death .
and i recognized his fear of &quot; is this fair ? &quot; and &quot; get a job . &quot;
and the real answer is , i didn &apos;t make them . i asked them .
but the perfect tools aren &apos;t going to help us if we can &apos;t face each other and give and receive fearlessly , but , more important , to ask without shame .
and we keep sending more every day .
and he &apos;s here also today .
these projects took thousands of actions in one year , making hundreds of thousands of people participating , creating millions of views .
i was looking for a picture of graffiti , little text input language , and i found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these , you know , the script writing things across the top of their blackboard , and they had added graffiti to it , and i &apos;m sorry about that .
and they said , oh no , you can &apos;t study theory about brains .
this is normal science .
and it &apos;s also , although the brain looks very complicated , things look complicated until you understand them .
it just turns out it &apos;s really hard to think of things , but once you &apos;ve thought of them , it &apos;s kind of easy to understand it .
a behavioral metric of what intelligence is , and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .
if you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that , it &apos;s got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn &apos;t fit .
i already said the word &quot; sentence . &quot; in music , if you &apos;ve heard a song before , if you heard jill sing those songs before , when she sings them , the next note pops into your head already -- you anticipate it as you &apos;re going . if it was an album of music , the end of one album , the next song pops into your head .
every single moment . and finally , let &apos;s think about how we test intelligence .
it &apos;s also memory of sequences .
but ultimately , the world &apos;s the limit here .
we need a little bit of police ; we need a little bit of military , but for defense .
your robe gives it away . &quot;
she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections .
this is rigoberta menchu tum .
and now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world &apos;s population .
so what needs to be done ?
she loved this . i got the &quot; abc &apos;s &quot; -- this is where i started my career as a professor , when my mother had time to read for me .
we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study , and we took a shot with a webcam , and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop .
but in fact , privacy is not about having something negative to hide .
you can tell people what you are going to do , and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information .
which brings me back to the garden of eden .
when i got my current job , i was given a good piece of advice , which was to interview three politicians every day .
and the fact is , people learn from people they love .
and they go to whole foods to get their baby formula , and whole foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they &apos;re on loan from amnesty international .
one of my favorite is that people named dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists , people named lawrence become lawyers , because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar , which is why i named my daughter president of the united states brooks .
when we watch a car chase in a movie , it &apos;s almost as if we are subtly having a car chase .
they have trouble relating to other people .
and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically , because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal .
through his suffering , hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are .
but that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
they &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
and therefore my challenge was to understand how can i get out the power from this pain .
a very supportive friend of mine , a well-wisher of mine , used to give me every month , 2,000 rupees for vegetables .
i &apos;m not asking you all to become mahatma gandhis or martin luther kings , or medha patkars , or something like that .
but &quot; lexicographical &quot; is the same pattern as &quot; higgledy-piggledy . &quot;
so he &apos;s really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .
right ? those little buttons , i had them all expanded except for the date chart .
how can this be ? i mean , i love books . i really love books .
being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
that &apos;s a lexicographical cop out , to say , &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting his picture taken there anytime soon .
so i &apos;m really sorry . but when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language , or a flag stands for the united states , it &apos;s a symbol of the country -- then you &apos;re using it synecdochically .
a magazine i &apos;d recently launched called business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory , busy pumping hot air into the bubble .
and at about the same time , and i think partly because of that , i started doing something that i &apos;d forgotten about in my business focus : i started to read again .
it &apos;s the mental equivalent of the full body massage .
what sapling &apos;s ownership means is that all of the proceeds of ted will go towards the causes that sapling stands for .
i could build for you a structure up here in 3d , millimeter accurate , that only you could see , or my friends at home .
&quot; they &apos;re not sure this rises to the level of harassment , and they &apos;re not set up technically to find the device . &quot;
it might be deadly .
i had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo .
thanks .
and at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
and as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
look at the client base for this .
in places like denmark and germany , they &apos;ve maxed out on wind already .
thorium reactor that nathan myhrvold &apos;s involved in .
and the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid , resulting if you use nuclear , or anything else , versus wind , csp or photovoltaics .
the spacing is something else .
here are the world wind resources .
there &apos;s plenty of solar and wind .
if we build all these nuclear power plants , all that waste is going to be on hundreds , if not thousands , of trucks and trains , moving through this country every day .
ray kurzweil and all the other talks -- we know that the stick is going up exponentially .
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive .
we americans bought alaska in the 1850s . it &apos;s called seward &apos;s folly .
this is gene cernan , a good friend of mine , saying , &quot; if i can go to the moon &quot; -- this is the last human on the moon so far -- &quot; nothing , nothing is impossible . &quot; but of course , we &apos;ve thought about the government always as the person taking us there .
if you expended that over an hour , it &apos;s about 1.6 megawatts .
rs : we &apos;ve got an altitude call of 368,000 feet .
and turns out 7-up has just done a little commercial that &apos;s airing this month .
orteig didn &apos;t pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across -- tried to go across the atlantic , and we didn &apos;t pay a dime until someone won the ansari x prize .
and i &apos;m not saying that we should copy nature , i &apos;m not saying we should mimic biology , instead i propose that we can borrow nature &apos;s processes .
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
the closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
but it was very labor intensive .
but look what happened in the course of that century .
you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
only about one in every four million kids has this disease , and in a simple way , what happens is , because of a mutation in a particular gene , a protein is made that &apos;s toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate .
it &apos;s such a rare disease , it would be hard for a company to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug .
here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
francis collins : we need better drugs -- now
we don &apos;t want to be all the same , but we want to respect each other and understand each other .
the existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation &apos;s development of cultural identity is very important .
now this museum is just as important to us as the west .
sm : going back to straddling between east and west , last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha .
we all seem to think that , you know , if we look down on the ground , there &apos;s nothing there .
and walked off . and i didn &apos;t expect that , because i expected one of these ...
so i realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that &apos;s huge .
and then i actually slow down my whole nervous system .
because it &apos;s such a small sculpture , nothing can go wrong .
ww : so what i did is the same process where i just kind of hold my breath and just work away very , very slowly , manipulating the plastic , cutting it , because it behaves different .
and whilst i &apos;m painting i have to be very careful , because the paint starts to turn into little blobs .
and she saw me walking around like this .
so it &apos;s sort of ellis island , and seeing america for the first time .
the flag had to be made out of little strands of gold .
he said , &quot; that is the battle of the self , the battle of the ego . &quot;
this is all you . and this is all us .
why ? because the soul , the human soul , embodies a piece of the divine breath , a piece of the divine soul .
&quot; i &apos;m bruce , &quot; i said , and promptly passed out .
would they yearn for my approval , my love , my voice ?
and she loved the idea , but she quickly started rejecting my nominees .
so a few weeks after my diagnosis , we went up to vermont , and i decided to put jeff as the first person in the council of dads .
and then in the 1980 &apos;s , they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective , and within weeks i had started that regimen .
of course , i had no hair and no immune system .
and that particularly happened -- there was one in my life -- is this council of dads that linda said , what we were talking about , it &apos;s like what the moms talk about at school drop-off .
and because walking was one of the first things i lost , i spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts .
come the one year anniversary of my journey , i went to see my surgeon , dr. john healey -- and by the way , healey , great name for a doctor .
diagnosed with cancer , bruce feiler worried first about his young family . so -- as he shares in this funny , rambling and ultimately thoughtful talk -- he asked his closest friends to become a &quot; council of dads , &quot; bringing their own lifetimes of wisdom to advise his twin daughters as they grow .
ao : there you are .
if i just put the microphone down for a bit , i &apos;m going to play a cluster of notes .
in fact , the first time , derek , you played that with an orchestra , you &apos;d learned the version that you &apos;d learned , and then the orchestra , in fact , did have a different version , so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert , derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra .
dp : let derek play it .
ah yes , a table .
i like to read books on it .
we want to know about health care .
i think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called ai in japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her .
the importance of learning in that time , when behavior is flexible -- and there &apos;s an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society .
they shoot everything , every single thing that moves that &apos;s bigger than a small rat ; they sun-dry it or smoke it .
and that &apos;s not just in the far-away developing world ; that &apos;s everywhere .
every individual has a role to play .
and then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in america , or maybe this is a group in israel , saying , &quot; yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . this is how you should do it . &quot;
now that we know what the problems are around the world , human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems .
so we go from , say , this beautiful and complex crystal as non-life , and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side .
we use this idea called self-assembly .
so some things that are missing is , for example , if you had a flow of energy through a system , what we &apos;d want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself , much like living systems do .
so remember , these are primitive things , so dancing protocells , that &apos;s very interesting to us .
so the challenge then is , throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab , and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze .
most of these don &apos;t contain dna , but yet they have lifelike properties .
in this case , of course , the roundabout with that micro-decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do .
this is one of them .
many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality .
so it &apos;s on legs , so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns .
but we &apos;ve kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly .
you may not have known that you need to communicate with fish , but there is now a device for you to do so .
and that &apos;s typically the paradigm under which we &apos;ve operated .
and we should begin by reimagining leather .
it can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells , and better yet , there is no hair to remove , no scars or insect &apos;s bites , and no waste .
we can design new materials , new products , and new facilities .
but the fact remains : the fundamental dna of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same .
we did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the 100 largest cities in the united states , and located the stations so you &apos;d be no more than two miles from a station at any time .
and a lot of people say , how do you sleep at night when you &apos;re rustling with a problem of that magnitude ?
man , her office was packed .
i was accepted to pepperdine university , and i came back to the same school that i attended to be a special ed assistant .
and as the very first pilot middle school in all of los angeles unified school district , you better believe there was some opposition .
pearl arredondo grew up in east los angeles , the daughter of a high-ranking gang member who was in and out of jail . many teachers wrote her off as having a problem with authority . now a teacher herself , she &apos;s creating a different kind of school and telling students her story so that they know it &apos;s okay if sometimes homework isn &apos;t the first thing on their minds .
it became a book . it became a show .
and léila came up with an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
our forest in brazil , that antique forest that was the size of california , is destroyed today 93 percent .
land completely destroyed , the erosion there , the land had dried .
so , i didn &apos;t grow up in new york .
it &apos;s held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in .
but i had another idea about this map .
we wanted to try and map these . and to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs .
we call this the muir web . and if you zoom in on it it looks like this .
this is the view from the east river , looking up murray hill at where the united nations is today .
or if we imagine the new york city metropolitan area , currently home to 12 million people , but 12 million people in the future , perhaps living at the density of manhattan , in only 36 percent of the area , with the areas in between covered by farmland , covered by wetlands , covered by the marshes we need .
and , you know , then you get all the way down to people who live in the asia-pacific region , or even more , africa .
you know , what we &apos;re out there doing is looking for examples of tools , models and ideas , which , if widely adopted , would change the game .
you can also start to change what you build .
we &apos;re starting to cover this more and more .
the second thing is tools for collaboration , be they systems of collaboration , or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration . right ?
and as we heard last night , as we &apos;ve heard earlier this week , are absolutely , fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions , is we &apos;ve got to craft new political realities .
you get -- this is a building in hyderabad , india .
well , there &apos;s all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet .
the store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar .
and the back story is this : sopa and pipa , as legislation , were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century .
but that wasn &apos;t what the media businesses wanted .
so pipa and sopa are round two .
if they break it , they will break it for everybody .
i &apos;d like to take you to another world .
she didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought i &apos;d let my family down .
so we started the barefoot college , and we redefined professionalism .
you are certified by the community you serve .
since 1986 , it hasn &apos;t leaked .
so we thought of starting a school at night for the children .
he &apos;s my donor .
of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men .
he said , &quot; do you know there &apos;s a solar-electrified village in sierra leone ? &quot;
she walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran .
this is some of the research that you &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re undertaking at the allosphere .
this is real afm -- atomic force microscope -- data from my colleagues in the solid state lighting and energy center .
we &apos;ve taken this information and we &apos;ve made a mathematical model out of it .
let &apos;s just run a quick diagnostic before i proceed with the rest of the talk .
human beings have something that we might think of as a &quot; psychological immune system . &quot;
and what did he have to say about his experience ?
and in our society , we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind .
now what &apos;s the right response to that ? &quot; yeah , right ! &quot;
right ? this is the change in liking score , the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked .
&quot; i &apos;m helping people accept the things they cannot change . &quot; indeed .
and look at what we find .
this is worth contemplating : &quot; the great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another ...
these rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide .
this guy went up , went supersonic , ripped the fin can off -- yard sale in the sky -- and a burning metal hunk coming back .
i said , &quot; you &apos;re a peach , ma . pop there ? &quot;
there are stories you tell from stages .
let me parenthetically pause here and tell you -- esther , my mother , had stopped driving several years ago , to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta .
and she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe .
and she &apos;s whistling , and finally i do the kind of birth breathing -- you know , that one ?
&quot; ma , are you still doing that ? &quot;
and why ? what is wrong with his underwear ? &quot;
well , i stood up to her .
i grew up with this woman .
i &apos;m thinking , &quot; accelerator , break . accelerator , break . &quot;
it &apos;s a beautiful hierarchy , and it works .
and i am astounded that i &apos;m standing here to tell you that .
instead of driving 12,000 miles a year , which is what the average city dweller does , they drive 500 miles a year . are they happy ?
the demand for parking , of course , is down , congestion and the co2 emissions .
so , i want to move now to the second part of my story , which is : when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing ? road pricing is coming .
so , the beauty of mesh networks : you can have these very low-cost devices .
what is the point ?
they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of toronto , and they settled into a new life .
my friend chris , who i just showed you a picture of , had been battling mental illness for some time .
but look , i said i wanted to do three things with you today .
i love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time .
it &apos;s a great cover .
and when my dad tells the story , he says , &quot; the craziest thing was , i &apos;d never seen any of that before , except bread .
you can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming .
to honor and remember .
we were really paralyzed .
and there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city .
at the same time the city had this need .
and i think this was the 21st , and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th .
dr : well here &apos;s the issue : we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site , and think about the need for a memorial .
do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or shouldn &apos;t be done ?
and essentially our structure was designed to be written on .
zzzzzzip for safety .
would it be crazy to know , 103 gs .
so it &apos;s going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day .
speak up also with coaching staff .
in the 17th century , a doodle was a simpleton or a fool -- as in yankee doodle .
here &apos;s the real definition : doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think .
thank you .
clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe .
so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product , unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available , you will probably choose to do something else .
the pool is already working today , two months later , with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed . this is unprecedented .
the air temperature was not too high , but it was not comfortable during these games .
but that &apos;s not all what we need to do . we need to use active systems .
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions , to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment , and we can do that with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun .
the main thing is a fix-it-locally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn &apos;t have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed .
they are basically referral services , essentially .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker .
and then i realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby .
so we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters .
now , i want to be very clear : we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .
and not only do we show them , but others can read them .
so , this work with emotions , which are so fundamental , then got us to thinking about : maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes .
and i can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you : who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network ?
and those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness do not reside in the carbon atoms ; they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms , or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms .
sometimes i &apos;m concerned that we hear about it so much that we &apos;ve come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency , even ease .
and a recent gallup poll asked participants how much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day .
they &apos;re more accepting of sadness than younger people are .
people over 50 don &apos;t go on blind dates .
they could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row .
ladies and gentlemen : the lxd .
many of you may have heard of the lakota , or at least the larger group of tribes called the sioux .
10 years later , the homestead act , signed by president lincoln , unleashed a flood of white settlers into native lands .
the news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into lakota nation .
to this day , this is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle .
the housing office is unable to build new structures , and existing structures are falling apart .
what is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that i just read to you ?
so , this incident that i &apos;m going to describe really began with some diarrhea .
that &apos;s been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years , that &apos;s mankind moving forward .
some people are doing that , many are not . what &apos;s going on ?
think about what that means for a second .
let &apos;s think about 10 for a second .
you see , what &apos;s going on here , and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world , some models that you use to understand the world .
and they say , &quot; you know what ? do i need turbo ? do i need this heavyweight car ? &quot;
so far , i &apos;ve been pretty negative .
this is about energy efficiency .
sendhil , thank you so much .
but you have to have the right tools .
well now if i take that sugar dough , the sugar dough doesn &apos;t want to conduct electricity .
have fun . thank you .
it just says &quot; money , &quot; and if you look down the side street , it says , &quot; does not make me happy . &quot;
if you do this , the common , the logic says you must turn the wrist .
she has left . no ! a big hand .
i start with three queens .
so here : 10 , jack , queen , king , ace .
not at the last card .
now i go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern .
three , four , five , six . then i calculate -- yeah , good .
lg : very good .
yeah .
i liked it . now , a little more difficult .
yeah ? ok .
so here , diamonds , hearts -- no , diamonds . good , good .
looks good , like batman . ow !
three -- three of diamonds . yes !
seven .
touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
you can see it by looking at my head .
that &apos;s the first group ; it &apos;s quite a small group .
so i &apos;m not going to go on until every single person in this room , downstairs and in aspen , and everybody else looking , will come to love and understand classical music .
let &apos;s try it again . ooh , the ted choir .
it &apos;s the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day , turns off the key in his car and says , &quot; aah , i &apos;m home . &quot; because we all know where home is .
think of it . 1,600 people , busy people , involved in all sorts of different things , listening , understanding and being moved by a piece by chopin .
people in my orchestra came up to me and said , &quot; ben , what happened ? &quot; that &apos;s what happened .
she told me this . she said , &quot; i walked out of auschwitz into life and i made a vow . and the vow was , i will never say anything that couldn &apos;t stand as the last thing i ever say . &quot;
karl duncker created this experiment that is used in a whole variety of experiments in behavioral science .
three and a half minutes longer . now this makes no sense right ?
same deal . you : we &apos;re timing for norms .
everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem .
but this time , people offered the highest rewards , they did the worst of all .
management did not emanate from nature .
and it &apos;s worked so well that atlassian has taken it to the next level with 20 percent time -- done , famously , at google -- where engineers can work , spend 20 percent of their time working on anything they want .
now if you had , just 10 years ago , if you had gone to an economist , anywhere , and said , &quot; hey , i &apos;ve got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia .
and the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you &apos;d want to hold on to , and that would glide easily through your hands .
that &apos;s the sun at that end .
so all the red sides , for example , face one direction : south .
i was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites .
it could be interacted with large crowds in different ways .
a lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies , and social business will take care of the rest .
but you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria , and you &apos;re considered a parasite yourself .
the third area of discrimination is the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue .
well , this created a real problem for these people , right ?
we netted for breast cancer alone , that year alone , 71 million dollars after all expenses .
we want it to read that we changed the world , and that part of the way we did that was by changing the way we think about these things .
let &apos;s look at the first video .
something must be wrong there , yeah ? but he &apos;s spreading happiness .
now look at me . &quot; aaaaaah , &quot; and i stop you . let &apos;s go .
the first one was : if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong .
because you didn &apos;t know when to play .
well , it is different . but isn &apos;t that controlling in the same way ?
can we have the next video , quickly ?
so that &apos;s a good thing .
you can see the baton left his hand . no more baton .
this bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor -- equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you .
if just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms , it would offset all the savings that we need to make , in carbon , over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change .
and as we sit , exchanging free ideas with each other , there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers , extracting the minerals to make all of those things .
and it &apos;s really about how systems , settlements , withstand shock from the outside .
we need national responses . we need local government responses .
and we see it all over the place as well now .
most education funding -- whether it &apos;s k through 12 , or the great universities or community colleges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets .
but what this means actually is that there &apos;s a pretense .
and california &apos;s not unique .
well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay .
we need to take the fact that the current employees , the future liabilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
this one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
i found myself growing outraged that someone like nathaniel could have ever been homeless on skid row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on skid row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
here &apos;s my clock .
anytime i had a memorable experience in my life , i would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
now in the middle of all this five senses work , i suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
almost everything kids do is art .
of course this is an infantile story , but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does .
there &apos;s no need .
of course , there were kids who had to .
works like this were hung in basel while i was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth .
some people turn into rockers like this .
in this course , all students must put on a play .
and in this moment , the nagging devil disappears .
he proudly said he played king lear .
i was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university .
global warming hoopla became time-consuming and distracted me from doing science -- partly because i had complained that the white house altered my testimony .
it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses .
small changes in earth &apos;s orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth .
hundreds of new orleans-like devastations around the world .
but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society , our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide , thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel -- mountaintop removal , longwall mining , fracking , tar sands , tar shale , deep ocean arctic drilling .
i &apos;ve been a professional stunt man for 13 years .
highly dangerous , but also you &apos;ll notice it doesn &apos;t look as though i &apos;m wearing anything underneath the suit .
they did it by remote control .
so again , science helps us , and with the engineering too -- the modifications to the car and the wheel .
and that &apos;s centre point in london .
i spoke with him on the phone a few months ago .
those are the drogue chutes . he had three of them .
if you &apos;re at 100,000 feet you die .
thank you very much for your time .
and we squander them , pretty ruthlessly .
and the third boy said , &quot; frank sent this . &quot;
i &apos;ve got two kids . he &apos;s 21 now ; my daughter &apos;s 16 .
and i like university professors , but you know , we shouldn &apos;t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement .
suddenly , degrees aren &apos;t worth anything . isn &apos;t that true ?
i saw a great t-shirt really recently which said , &quot; if a man speaks his mind in a forest , and no woman hears him , is he still wrong ? &quot;
what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination .
in a thick arabic accent , my brain went , &quot; berfect . &quot;
now , while preparing for the tour , i had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive .
so , as for the outsiders looking in , watch the cnn report on the second amman comedy festival .
today , some 25 , 30 years later , we &apos;re talking about a mortality rate that &apos;s reduced by 85 percent .
but you can see actually they are further down this list , and that &apos;s because we &apos;re talking here about disability .
we &apos;re going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we &apos;re going to hear about drugs or we &apos;re going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules , or maybe into some sort of very flat , unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia .
that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders , brain circuit disorders , has a behavioral disorder .
we also heard that 250 billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling .
and so all our schools are english medium schools .
all parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves , but they need to believe that change is possible .
take a look at this little girl who was one of the 28 children from all privileged schools , best schools in the country that was selected for the duke university talent identification program and was sent to iim ahmedabad .
and our children are coming back home with bags full of medals , with lots of admirers and friends .
and if you ask him what he wants to do , he will say , &quot; i want to horsing . &quot;
and he graduated with his doctorate from harvard , and he set up a little consulting shop in white plains , new york .
they were looking for the perfect pepsi , and they should have been looking for the perfect pepsis . trust me .
so they came to howard , and they said , fix us .
in six varieties : cheese , light , robusto , rich &amp; amp ; hearty , old world traditional , extra-chunky garden .
used to be , there were two mustards . french &apos;s and gulden &apos;s .
they don &apos;t give you five options on the reduction , right ?
i &apos;ll give you one last illustration of variability , and that is -- oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t have the pustules or the redness and inflammation .
if i used someone else &apos;s pre-death , i apologize , i think i made it up .
well , we &apos;ve created a system where if you build it , they will come .
decades later , it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection .
vannevar bush with his memex -- this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips -- he had this vision .
and they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right ; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom .
so i wrote a book about this in &apos; 93 , but as i was finishing the book , i had to do a little bit of typesetting , and i was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it , so i bought a computer .
we could do circular narratives that were literally circular .
why is this important ?
now maybe that &apos;s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &apos;d encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light .
and the key detail of this is that fey &apos;s scripts weren &apos;t written by her and they weren &apos;t written by the snl writers .
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
but it &apos;s when you put all of these elements together -- when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that &apos;s crafted from honesty and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
that is a lot of punch for 14 words .
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
it reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish , primarily .
they school as adolescents , and become behemoth loners as adults .
and it just so happens that &apos;s a parasite hanging off the mola .
and they &apos;ll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head , and the fish come up and they just clean , clean , clean -- because the molas , you know , there &apos;s just a smorgasbord of parasites .
they &apos;re super industrious .
it was a big idea , for sure , and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data , trends and other information regarding the globe , on this sphere .
this is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in may .
preston reed : it &apos;s mind-blowing , and i feel really proud , really honored .
so , he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice .
have we stopped seeing injustice ?
and i thought , &quot; this is what we need , as a language . &quot;
listen , go fetch that cotton sari you have .
your grandparents were peaceful people .
hello civilization . hello , 21st century .
her mother the queen said , &quot; hai , don &apos;t whistle . &quot;
&quot; father , mother , this man shall be my wife . &quot;
he talked about doing it with marbles , having gates and what we now call shift registers , where you shift the gates , drop the marbles down the tracks .
when rca said no , that &apos;s when they decided to build it in princeton , where freeman works at the institute .
the input and the output was by teletype tape at first .
&quot; aha ! &quot; so , they figured out it &apos;s a code problem .
i know when i &apos;m licked . &quot;
he would run that thing all night long , running these things , if anybody remembers stephen wolfram , who reinvented this stuff .
so there it is , 50 years later , sitting there -- sort of suspended animation .
george dyson : the birth of the computer
any doctor , any specialist will tell you that .
we &apos;ve got a new one this year , but we &apos;ll work on that next season .
he &apos;s at the sharp knife-edge of this problem .
labeling is a massive problem .
what is school ? who invented it ? what &apos;s the purpose of school ?
and yes , by the way , it is fast food : it &apos;s sloppy joes , it &apos;s burgers , it &apos;s wieners , it &apos;s pizzas , it &apos;s all of that stuff .
your kids will be having milk at school , breakfast and lunch . right ?
it &apos;s very , very preventable .
now , also , back to the sort of big brands : labeling , i said earlier , is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted .
huntington &apos;s kitchen . i work with a community .
thank you .
is nothing sacred anymore , for heaven &apos;s sake ?
and so nothing is going into the hackers .
they appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser .
and he did a great job in it .
he impressed in the private sector , developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in 2008 .
they &apos;re just relentless and obsessive about what they do .
and that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore , again , because of our development patterns .
now i keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band , but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots -- and suburbia is full of them .
and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family , the family households , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places .
this was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
and it &apos;s transformed from being an ugly , unsafe , undesirable address , to becoming a beautiful , attractive , dignified sort of good address .
and where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
but culturally , we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic , and we expect that .
ok , at first women were a little shy , a little reluctant to talk .
and i really haven &apos;t gotten off it . i think if you had told me when i was younger that i was going to grow up , and be in shoe stores , and people were going to scream out , &quot; there she is , the vagina lady ! &quot;
that &apos;s essentially a gender ; that &apos;s essentially a resource of the planet , which is women .
a &quot; vagina warrior &quot; is a woman , or a vagina-friendly man , who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it , and rather than getting an ak-47 or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete , they hold the violence in their bodies ; they grieve it ; they experience it ; and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn &apos;t happen to anybody else .
we were there a week ago , when there were 7,000 people on the street , and it was truly a miracle . and as we walked through the streets , the people of juarez , who normally don &apos;t even come into the streets because the streets are so dangerous , literally stood there and wept to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community .
and he &apos;d show up obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand , which is that when we give in the world what we want the most , we heal the broken part inside each of us .
his name was sandor teszler .
but help was on the way , and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the swiss embassy .
and two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers , white and black , poured in to see the facility for the first time , they were met by the 16 foremen , white and black , standing shoulder to shoulder .
&quot; yo napot , sandor ! &quot;
and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity , that irrepressible desire to know , no matter what the subject , no matter what the cost , even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even money that the human race won &apos;t be around to imagine anything in the year 2100 , a scant 93 years from now .
there was an important lesson for me in that .
so i want you to use your imaginations , thinking of these wall-high objects , some of them 10 meters wide , depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today , thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer , violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism .
i think for most americans , knowledge of the islamic world was pretty slight before 9 / 11 , and then it was thrust upon us in one of america &apos;s darkest hours , and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event .
hawa abdi : many people -- 20 years for somalia -- &#91; were &#93; fighting .
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society .
talk to me about your decision , dr. abdi , and your decision , dr. mohamed , to work together -- for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances .
and when i saw the people who needed me , i was staying with them to help , because i &#91; could &#93; do something for them .
they &apos;ve been called the &quot; saints of somalia . &quot; doctor hawa abdi and her daughter deqo mohamed discuss their medical clinic in somalia , where -- in the face of civil war and open oppression of women -- they &apos;ve built a hospital , a school and a community of peace .
mostly discoveries made by accident .
but in the early days , the only way i could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine , a very small submarine , and go down to the bottom .
running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes .
this is what a real one looks like , on the juan de fuca ridge .
that did not make sense . they were not above a magma chamber .
more recently , finding ancient history .
we own all of that blue and yet , like i say , particularly the western territorial trust , we don &apos;t have maps of them . we don &apos;t have maps of them .
we need to be not only proud of our universities .
there were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process , and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration , thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long , hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions .
robert ghrist : welcome to calculus .
it started on a given day , and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments .
so here the video pauses , and the student types in the answer into the box and submits . obviously they weren &apos;t paying attention .
it was tried only in small classes , but there it showed , for example , that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis .
this is a distribution of wrong answers to one of andrew &apos;s assignments .
so the goal here is to try and push , and see how far we can get towards the green curve .
i was thinking about my place in the universe , and about my first thought about what infinity might mean , when i was a child .
and of course we live in a society that &apos;s all about contradicting other peoples &apos; reality .
i don &apos;t approve of them because arguments , of course , are all about contradiction , and they &apos;re shaped by the values that i have questions with .
not a caress , but a wave of pain .
or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women .
and so i wanted something that was more interactive .
like for instance a mime once -- or a meme as he called himself .
&quot; oh no . thanks though , i &apos;ll leave them here . thanks very much .
you know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes .
finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared .
stephen petranek : at first , it all seemed a little fantastical to me , but after challenging a lot of these ideas , i began to take a lot of them seriously . and then september 11 happened , and i thought , ah , god , i can &apos;t go to the ted conference and talk about how the world is going to end .
something like 98 percent of all people with depression , and i mean really severe depression -- i have a friend with stunningly severe depression -- this is a curable disease , with present medicine and present technology .
how much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species ?
and they get to prioritize , you know ?
we have an electromagnetic field around the earth , and it &apos;s constantly bombarded by high-energy particles , like protons .
one of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the earth is , is that we have -- you know , we don &apos;t have good weather data from 60 years ago , much less data on things like the ozone layer .
really more like 500 years to do it right .
number two -- my favorite -- we meet a rogue black hole .
nothing to worry about , right ?
but we would have lots of time , if we see it coming .
how might the world end ? stephen petranek lays out the challenges that face us in the drive to preserve the human race . will we be wiped out by an asteroid ? eco-collapse ? how about a particle collider gone wild ?
they define what the system is .
if you can see the complexity , you can see how tiny , little eddies and large eddies and the motion -- this is just sea surface temperature , but it &apos;s immensely complicated .
well , marcel proust has this wonderful saying that , &quot; the real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory , but possibly in having new sets of eyes , &quot; new ways of seeing things , a new mindset .
and let me show you what &apos;s behind it .
on the left hand side there is a large volcano called axial seamount .
nanotechnology : this is a small generator .
and they fly into the erupting volcano .
and i think , when i listen to these incredible people here , i &apos;ve been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas , so many visions .
you can be a general , a politician , an economist who is depressed , a musician in a minor key , a painter in dark colors .
and i think that is what architecture is , it &apos;s radical .
it &apos;s a language . but it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write .
so i do believe that architecture as i see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have , in every intimacy that we possess .
you know , it &apos;s true , the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
so i &apos;ve been never interested in the forgettable reuse , rehashing of the same things over and over again , which , of course , get accolades of critics .
so yes , i do believe that the risk we take in every building .
it &apos;s political . there is so many parties to this project .
not just for new york , but for the world .
and in order to do that for cars , you have to come up with a really energy efficient car , so that means making it incredibly light , and so what you &apos;re seeing here is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car made in north america .
and our third generation car , which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $ 30,000 car .
if the sun wasn &apos;t there , we &apos;d be a frozen ice ball at three degrees kelvin , and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation .
for you , the dream here then is that -- i mean , who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term ?
obviously , &quot; he started with a large one , &quot; is the punchline .
em : absolutely . so the thing about rockets is that they &apos;re all expendable .
so that &apos;s just to give a sense of scale .
physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive , like quantum mechanics .
most people that are following the story of angelina jolie and brad pitt will know where namibia is .
whenever we tried to hunt , we were called poachers .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well ?
and sometimes , once they were caught , they were treated with respect , brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams .
they stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals .
i want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
do i do this three times a week ?
and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart .
as a chef , i realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
we &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
what do the computer models say about this , that and the other thing ?
it &apos;s a big undertaking . i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team .
at the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year .
particularly in the world of sea ice , the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago , and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with .
so we wind time backwards now .
a mile of retreat in 75 minutes across the calving face , in that particular event , three miles wide .
and for the last four years , my coauthor phanish puranam and i spent investigating this topic .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of india .
very quickly , they get bored , and they start innovating , and they start telling the boss how to do this job better , and out of this process innovation comes product innovations , which are then marketed around the world .
in fact , if you look at the number of patents filed over history , i think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the usa as a private company .
a time for even grimmer stuff than that , like autopsies and embalmings in isabel allende &apos;s &quot; the house of the spirits . &quot;
he languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 -- which incidentally is how old alberto giacometti was when he died .
would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
i &apos;m very thankful to jay and to mark and the tedmed team for inviting me today to describe a fourth tool , a new tool , that we call tumor treating fields .
as cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates , the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three-dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end-on-end to form chains .
in that time , novocure &apos;s developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body .
he received high dose radiation to the head .
by month 12 , we could argue whether there &apos;s a little bit of material around the edges , but it &apos;s essentially completely gone .
there &apos;s research underway now at harvard medical school to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit .
but for the desert society this is no program ; this is their life .
it can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon .
in many portions , water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything .
or , if you want to paint , you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms .
but this is not ground water .
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words , so we can say a thousand words right now , an another thousand words .
these are the trees .
the battle against malaria is being won , with deaths from malaria down 27 percent , according to the latest world bank data .
ten percent &apos;s come from india .
they will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth .
and the countries on the right hand side , you &apos;ll see the per capita gdp , basically every country with a per capita gdp of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , has got a corruption score of roughly , what &apos;s that , about three ?
ignore the scale on the bottom for a second .
no , not right now , just 30 seconds .
to put it very simply , the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity , if you give them enough devices , democracy will inevitably follow .
and police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek , which is &quot; elude the cat &quot; in chinese slang , with other inmates and hit his head against the wall , which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers .
and finally , the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes , both at home and abroad .
so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space , a total rip-off from abraham maslow .
now kendall on the other hand -- and like i said , he &apos;s only 15 months older than her -- he &apos;d come to me crying , it &apos;s like as soon as i would hear him cry , a clock would go off .
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box .
we all looked up to him .
she &apos;s 16 years old .
so we &apos;re very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
but , somehow , none of that adds up to me , to what i think india really can aim to contribute in the world , in this part of the 21st century .
in fact , they were so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy .
fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones .
and it was the most popular television show in afghan history .
india gave refuge to the jews , fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the babylonians , and said thereafter by the romans .
but , the whole point is that india is the nationalism of an idea .
trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt can leave you permanently blind .
i &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first african to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , i did all of this just because i didn &apos;t want to bathe . thank you .
so i started working with this thing , with a bunch of collaborators .
kary mullis : a next-gen cure for killer infections
if you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind , you wouldn &apos;t see why they tasted sweet .
so babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do .
you all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper .
before founding ideo , david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends .
now , what i &apos;m going to do is , i &apos;m going to see how -- i can &apos;t see out of these , ok .
why do we have them ? well , as i said , we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important .
we &apos;ve all told stories about how , on christmas morning , our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them .
i wasn &apos;t actually very interested in whether they were all different .
we don &apos;t know , but it may be .
and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again , learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .
this is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype , explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital .
so role-play is actually , i think , quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences .
and so far , i admit , this might feel like it &apos;s a message just to go out and play like a kid .
because it &apos;s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute .
but then i stopped , because i figured i was this hot-shot guy and i shouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like magic .
my partner and i , thom , we had to let all our employees go .
and mostly i wanted to be the fifth member of depeche mode or duran duran .
and then i started conducting , and i ended up doing my master &apos;s degree at the juilliard school .
stephen hanson from sweden .
i just couldn &apos;t believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island , sending electronic messages in bottles to each other .
it &apos;s so wonderful to sing together again ! &quot;
and it &apos;s a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first .
because that way you have to stop and restart the engine , and that would use quite some fuel , wouldn &apos;t it ?
i just think that this example points us to a general realization , and that is no matter what technology or design you look at , even something we consider as well intended and as good in its effects -- like stutzman &apos;s freedom -- comes with certain values embedded in it .
they have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us .
what are the values you &apos;re using to judge those ?
so my co-teacher , sebastian thrun , and i thought , there must be a better way .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;ll do one in the fall .
and so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack .
the whole limb extends out . the body flexes backwards -- just a spectacular movement .
and this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while .
so the next and final question was , well , how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they &apos;re able to break open snails ?
again , going back to those high-speed videos , there &apos;s a pretty good hint of what might be going on .
because obviously , if it &apos;s breaking snails , the poor limb must be disintegrating . and indeed it does .
we still have one foot in the dark ages .
because it &apos;s a problem we have .
and that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence , which is alien to us .
and this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
okay , can we cut that ? lights back up please .
thank you .
when we started this project , one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .
the concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on .
kate orff : reviving new york &apos;s rivers -- with oysters !
so what ended up happening , actually , is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because , as we now know , cholera is actually in the water .
something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood .
so for the last 20 years , since my dental experience , i have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people .
and i &apos;d snuck in -- because it &apos;s totally illegal to have a picture of the dalai lama in tibet -- it &apos;s the quickest way you can get arrested .
and in this period of time -- since that time -- as much oil , or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident , was spilled in this little area of the amazon , and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move .
and this is john doolikahn , who &apos;s the shaman of the kalash .
this is all their movies . we &apos;ve got about 60 movies that these kids have made , and they &apos;re quite incredible .
how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped , and so forth ?
and the moon is only two seconds away , so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light , it &apos;s the moon two seconds ago , and who cares .
and from them in the time sequence we &apos;re going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
there are some places you can &apos;t look because of our own galaxy , or because there are no telescopes available to do it .
and that is , you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules , but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated .
so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .
this is how , if you took billions of years to go around , it might look to you , right ?
so we &apos;re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop .
so that &apos;s no emailing , texting , no internet , no tv , no chatting , no eating , no reading , not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future .
others will turn to their friends , their family , looking for support .
so for example , right now , if i focus too much on the balls , then there &apos;s no way that i can relax and talk to you at the same time .
or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round and round your mind .
now , i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism , seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole .
or what if , instead of painting with a brush , i could only paint with karate chops ?
when i think back to my three years away from art , away from my dream , just going through the motions , instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream , i just quit , i gave up .
it turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone .
for them , environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation .
what sounds like faith , soft faith , may actually be fact , because the surprising truth -- i mean , there are no studies , but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on earth for the last 27 years , have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation , by some estimates up to 10 years .
i was excited .
it matters to me because i think we &apos;re setting ourselves up for trouble -- trouble certainly in how we relate to each other , but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self-reflection .
we get to edit , and that means we get to delete , and that means we get to retouch , the face , the voice , the flesh , the body -- not too little , not too much , just right .
it seemed to be looking in her eyes .
one , that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be ; two , that we will always be heard ; and three , that we will never have to be alone .
it &apos;s as though we &apos;re using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self .
because it &apos;s when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other .
not everybody could earn an a or a b , and i didn &apos;t like that way of judging it .
there are some things that helped me , i think , be better than i would have been . i know i &apos;m not what i ought to be , not what i should be . but i think i &apos;m better than i would have been if i hadn &apos;t run across certain things .
i had three rules , pretty much , that i stuck with practically all the time .
that &apos;s my job . i &apos;m paid to do it . pitifully poor , but i am paid to do it .
you &apos;d be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times .
and as time went by , and i learned more about other things , i think it worked a little better , as far as the results . but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things , and not the end itself .
and i thought , &quot; oh gracious , if these two players , either one of them &quot; -- they were different years , but i thought about each one at the time he was there -- &quot; oh , if he ever makes the varsity , our varsity must be pretty miserable , if he &apos;s good enough to make it . &quot;
we can use , actually , biomaterials and the cells together .
that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure , this tubularized structure , which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so .
a few weeks later , you have your engineered organ that we &apos;re able to implant back into the patient .
you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves .
you can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today .
lm : ten years ago , when i had my surgery -- and it &apos;s really great to see him .
i &apos;m going to explain what it is and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes -- that this isn &apos;t a flimsy idea , or a short-term trend , but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume , but how we consume .
yet 99 percent of trades on swaptree happen successfully , and the one percent that receive a negative rating , it &apos;s for relatively minor reasons , like the item didn &apos;t arrive on time .
they &apos;re growing up sharing -- files , video games , knowledge .
the second is collaborative lifestyles .
instead , these people had to walk , bike , take the train , or other forms of public transport .
with every spammer we flag , with every idea we post , comment we share , we &apos;re actually signaling how well we collaborate , and whether we can or can &apos;t be trusted .
every time school closed -- it was a boarding school and i was seven -- you had to travel until you find them .
and these guys took off , followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them .
newscaster : there &apos;s a large path of destruction here in town .
there were a couple large , sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church , but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet .
co : the puppy &apos;s missing , and insurance just doesn &apos;t cover the chimneys .
so they use post-its or excel or facebook .
mo : we needed canvasing tools , donations databasing , needs reporting , remote volunteer access , all in an easy-to-use website .
we &apos;ve been able to see the same transformation in texas and in alabama .
and here are the statistics .
as we passed , two boys were climbing the mount kenya of trash .
they develop -- you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other , room , after room , after room .
those green things in the foreground are mangoes .
one is that -- it &apos;s called &quot; gecekondu &quot; in turkish , which means &quot; built overnight , &quot; and if you build your house overnight in turkey , you can &apos;t be evicted without due process of law , if they don &apos;t catch you during the night .
and my mum said , &quot; darling , remember that you can &apos;t see and you can &apos;t feel the picture and you can &apos;t feel the print on the page . &quot;
and it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers .
it had a speech synthesizer .
i &apos;m going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it .
in no other latin american country are there more than a couple of thousand .
this is the world we live in .
as far as protecting yourself against alzheimer &apos;s disease , well , it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and we &apos;re creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs .
reuther &apos;s problem in that anecdote is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that &apos;s full of machines , and we see this very clearly in the statistics .
and ted &apos;s kids have grown up in a two-parent home , while bill &apos;s absolutely have not over time .
we have to do better than this .
he said , &quot; i am a firm believer in the people .
then , on december 26th last year , just two months ago , that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami .
the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask , &quot; where is god in all this ?
that &apos;s just not acceptable to intelligent christians , and we must acknowledge it .
i merely , most respectfully , return him the ticket . &quot;
in you , in me , mind and body and spirit .
and how would one deepen such a faith ?
and that &apos;s the very first use of the word .
imagine a world and basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old .
and so , already small amounts of technology were transforming the world .
but we do know that the self-organization trend throughout the universe is long , and it began with things like galaxies ; they maintained their order for billions of years .
at the same time , it wants to give us things , and what it gives us is basically progress .
when we have a bad idea , the response to a bad idea is not no ideas , it &apos;s not to stop thinking .
it &apos;s more than just gadgets ; it &apos;s more than just things that people invent .
this can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
it used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
and we thought , &quot; oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; and they didn &apos;t .
so there &apos;s no stigma .
notice the title of the book , &quot; the book that was never checked out : titanic . &quot;
and so we went into thurgood marshall high school , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
and it became a gateway to the community .
this is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . and it limits , really , their sales .
and he couldn &apos;t escape it .
i &apos;m going to switch to &quot; we , &quot; and not &quot; i , &quot; hope : we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
i just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking .
in my travels and in my work , from congo to afghanistan , from sudan to rwanda , i have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same , but the fears of war are the same .
the front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space , guiding missiles toward unseen targets , while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist .
so that woman walked for 20 years , so she would not be kidnapped again .
that mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do .
i was in milan last week , for the italian launch .
so i &apos;m mostly driving along , okay , and then i saw this sign .
many of you may not like tofu because you haven &apos;t had good tofu , but tofu &apos;s a good food . it &apos;s a very simple kind of food .
this is a sad thing , but it &apos;s actually a happy thing in a way , because you can remember them in their pure form .
i did this series of calendars for shiseido .
this is a new way to type , on my old , color classic .
i was looking for some kind of form , and in the end , i made 100 butter-fries . do you get it ?
so enjoy your sushi meal later , with the laws of simplicity .
he &apos;s an expert in aging . this horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old , twenty-four years old , seventy-four , ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data . so , brain strength increases up to 60 , and then after 60 , it sort of goes down . kind of depressing in a way .
optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn &apos;t look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the united states , minus an area roughly equal to the state of arizona .
fox : two . cnn : two . c zero .
but geothermal , concentrating solar , advanced photovoltaics , efficiency and conservation .
what a burden we have . &quot; i would like to ask you to reframe that . how many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts ?
buckminster fuller once wrote , &quot; if the future of all human civilization depended on me , what would i do ?
you work over different time zones , you talk to very different people , you multitask . we all know it , and we do it kind of automatically .
in this case i &apos;m showing more the designers &apos; work , because they &apos;re the ones that have really been stimulated .
something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue , so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally .
that &apos;s a term that i coined a few years ago while i was thinking of how pressed we are together , and at the same time how these small objects , like the walkman first and then the ipod , create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space .
as the capacity of computers becomes really , really big , and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger , we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path .
there &apos;s another one that throws plates and breaks them .
and i looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice .
it turns out what we found was pretty surprising .
and what we really found was that alpha , if we think about it , is the organizational structure of the insurgency .
so this graph here , i &apos;m going to show you now .
one of my favorite cartoon characters is snoopy .
there are others who feel they can &apos;t confront compassion anymore , and so they turn off the television and don &apos;t watch .
there has to be a willingness to do good deeds , but not , of course , at the expense of our own sanity .
so we try and get rid of those , and so doing , try to get rid of the habits , the emotions , the ideas that enslave us , that make our eyes closed , give us tunnel vision so we don &apos;t see the needs of others -- and free ourselves and free ourselves from that .
and he says , &quot; god , you really did want it . you wanted my bread .
i &apos;m a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist , so i put children to sleep for a living .
wrap it in an ace bandage , take some ibuprofen for a week or two , and that &apos;s the end of the story .
it &apos;s almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch , the toilet flushed three doors down , or your dishwasher went on , or your computer monitor turned off .
it released its energy all at once , and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing .
now , you wouldn &apos;t want that falling on your foot or your head , because it would do that to it .
if one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere , it would cause a panic .
apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004 .
that means we can do it again .
so think about this , right ?
but it &apos;s only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what &apos;s going on .
and you have a problem making ends meet .
anyway , after that whole , big , long explanation , the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke -- is , are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson ?
but it &apos;s one thing to have a concept ; it &apos;s a totally separate thing to actually make it work .
we were the best that they could do .
anyway , he &apos;s running independent newspaper there .
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries .
and those can be environmental bonds .
now , i &apos;m going try an experiment . i don &apos;t do experiments , normally . i &apos;m a theorist .
somewhere in some other planet , orbiting some very distant star , maybe in a another galaxy , there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are , and are interested in science . it &apos;s not impossible ; i think there probably are lots .
there are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .
here &apos;s an example of this similarity .
the next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .
four sources told it . that when they had the plague in cambridge , and he went down to his mother &apos;s farm -- because the university was closed -- he saw an apple fall from a tree , or on his head or something .
that &apos;s a general rule , and it &apos;s critically important to realize that .
it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or &quot; aesop &apos;s fables , &quot; he was so excited he couldn &apos;t sleep .
he eventually won a seat in congress .
so he put the pen down .
president johnson did dance with me that night .
and then he said , &quot; you remind me of my mother . &quot;
he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales .
so i finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end .
i love the brooklyn dodgers , as you do , but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely .
but today , this thing is , i believe , a major player in the politics of the middle east .
this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we &apos;ve got .
cyrus begins in the 530s bc .
and it enters now another story .
and it &apos;s quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah , and yet , jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk .
and the obvious emblem is cyrus .
it is a document that can mean so many things , for iran and for the region .
this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psychomotor development .
lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping , rocking back and forth , or aggression , and in some institutions , psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children , whilst in others , children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others .
the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support , empowering communities to look after their own children .
maybe there &apos;s a little change i can get involved in .
it poisoned his blood . he died when i was 11 .
it wasn &apos;t about the end result .
i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .
the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence .
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously , i &apos;m delighted that this man , ahmad fawzi , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get unicef involved .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
but more importantly , we wanted to go back , because these people in afghanistan were the heroes .
we &apos;ve got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce .
it &apos;s all about the individuals .
now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it , but we eat them .
maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons .
i don &apos;t think it looks like us .
so a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons , but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos .
and what is it that we do that no other animal does , and which i believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large , largest number of neurons in the cortex ?
i set up my studio in the red-light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing , and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile .
my job is to make arms and legs -- well it &apos;s not completely true .
anyway , in 1992 , the mujahideen took all afghanistan .
and he said , &quot; the red cross has closed . &quot;
we have to go away . we cannot stay here . &quot;
but people were coming .
inside , all of us panting , i sat a moment and i heard rafi telling his father , &quot; father , you can run faster than me . &quot;
that was the job .
and it &apos;s even cruel to think of anything like this .
it &apos;s good for everybody .
there are plenty of countries at war like afghanistan .
the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership .
now what does this have to do with leadership ?
a ghana airways pilot falls into the same predicament .
it was brilliant .
this was not the world that i &apos;d want my children to grow up in .
now , a month into this project , we &apos;d just started classes .
it &apos;s the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university .
planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling , but whose streets we can &apos;t walk .
however , these are just the tip of the iceberg .
the other assumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions .
i play the part of a magician , a wizard , if you will , a real wizard .
and she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
i don &apos;t think so .
because , the bottom line is , the sponsors love it , and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .
a professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
what is homeopathy ?
we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal , state and local authorities to get them to do something .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;m james randi , and i &apos;m waiting .
those machines go the proverbial junkyard .
my colleague , dr. paul fenton , was living this reality .
now that used to be a dangerous guessing game , because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened .
this is in 13 hospitals in four countries , and since 2010 , we &apos;ve done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events .
we offer a two-year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education .
it &apos;s a syllabary and reads from left to right .
there was the bomb , and there &apos;s now .
we were told , we were assured , that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate , the healthier we &apos;d be .
but industry lobbyists would never let that happen .
and those moms bought and prepared food .
oranges became common in new york .
there were fewer meals with home-cooked breads , desserts and soups , because all of them could be bought at any store .
by the &apos; 70s , home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets -- and we all have our favorites , actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .
and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now , it &apos;s not going to be 40 years .
eat real food .
so my common sense , my good intentions , were in conflict with my taste buds .
&#91; beautiful &#93; &#91; intriguing &#93; so you don &apos;t have to say a lot .
once you get that electronic tattoo , you &apos;re going to be rolling up and down for a long time , so as you go through this stuff , just be careful what you post .
i want to talk today about -- i &apos;ve been asked to take the long view , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view .
but let &apos;s suppose we did this .
so that &apos;s a large number .
suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these .
contraceptives , cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques -- that sounds ominous , but the distinction between what is a technology -- a gadget would be the archetype -- and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle .
imagine a species that just didn &apos;t have this neural machinery for processing music .
then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are .
jh : now is this electromagnetic here , or are these static ?
jh : it looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
and then i left gaps so you could see the one that was done before .
jh : oh , let &apos;s hope so . oh , my god , let &apos;s .
tom , thank you so much . it &apos;s been really , really great .
and he tells us to pay , but we don &apos;t speak english .
i was in my 20s before i ever went to an art museum .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
this isn &apos;t photoshopped .
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; love nests . &quot;
and i was like , &quot; get dressed for a funeral . we &apos;re going to go do some work . &quot;
she created the swiss people named the uvulites , and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for .
the next , this is by sam sandy .
my talk is &quot; flapping birds and space telescopes . &quot;
and it raises a question : what changed ?
this fish , 400 scales -- again , it is one uncut square , only folding .
but we &apos;re going to start small .
i can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements .
actually , lots of people in origami now put toes into their models .
it folds in thirds . it &apos;s a very simple pattern -- you wouldn &apos;t even call that origami .
japan aerospace &#91; exploration &#93; agency flew a solar sail , and you can see here that the sail expands out , and you can still see the fold lines .
robert lang is a pioneer of the newest kind of origami -- using math and engineering principles to fold mind-blowingly intricate designs that are beautiful and , sometimes , very useful .
it was wonderful working with yves behar .
this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in .
it was young , single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood .
it used to be that you were a guy who went to high school but you had a specific set of skills , and with the help of a union , you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life .
so for some reason men just don &apos;t end up going back to college .
now you laugh , but that quote has kind of a sting to it , right ?
and sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child .
and we &apos;re always below the glass ceiling , the women .
and the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting .
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it &apos;s china , greece , the hindu civilization , or the mayas , or egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies , not about their everyday life .
whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
and the number of us who live outside the old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly , by 64 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &apos;s really hard to get your bearings when you &apos;re in midair .
and i sat down , and i began to write , and write , and write , even though i &apos;d gone there really to get away from my desk .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i &apos;ve done during my first five tedtalks .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
will they move on ?
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
the world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth . this is the paradoxical answer that hans rosling unveils at ted @ cannes using colorful new data display technology .
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go .
and i started doing research , and we found , very excitingly , that the skin produces nitric oxide .
now , what we were careful to do was , vitamin d is made by ultraviolet b rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin d story .
there is no change in blood flow , in dilatation of the blood vessels .
and this is ongoing work , but dermatologists -- i mean , i &apos;m a dermatologist .
this is actually a very stunning statistic .
the challenge occurs when there is an injury .
it &apos;s bringing the cells into the body . it &apos;s allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue , and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away .
but they are really acting mostly as conduits .
we take the scaffold , we seed it with cells , and you can now see here , the valve leaflets opening and closing .
we actually take the donor liver , we use very mild detergents , and we , by using these mild detergents , we take all the cells out of the liver .
why ? because they will not reject .
i &apos;m a surgeon so that &apos;s not that funny .
kids , when we grow up , have dreams , and we have passions , and we have visions , and somehow we get those things crushed .
our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .
and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re giving them ritalin and saying , &quot; don &apos;t be an entrepreneurial type .
when i was growing up as a young kid , i had no choice , because i was taught at a very early , young age -- when my dad realized i wasn &apos;t going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school -- that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age .
but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector .
so i would collect the tips and get payment .
so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown .
you just needed to have a supply and demand and this audience who bought into you .
you know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin ? so what , right ?
anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want .
and they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in .
hopefully this inspires you to take what you &apos;ve heard from me and do something with it to change the world .
and within that one , to continually narrow the focus , learning more and more about less and less ; this , despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things .
mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students .
contrary to widely held assumptions , an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking .
ideology , zealotry , unsubstantiated opinions simply won &apos;t do .
so what do you do when you feel overwhelmed ?
great , here we go .
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources .
it should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who &apos;s had a sing-a-long or a dance party with a group of good friends .
this man was a remixer extraordinaire .
that &apos;s number one . number two : this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create .
&quot; i will not put tacks on the teacher &apos;s chair .
i remember one day my best friend brian was working on a project .
and he &apos;s just a lovely guy .
that we could take people who had the fear that they weren &apos;t creative , and we could take them through a series of steps , kind of like a series of small successes , and they turn fear into familiarity , and they surprise themselves .
he turned it into an adventure for the kids .
what was my calling ? what should i do ?
as we design these things , we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds , and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems .
and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland .
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation .
and what vannevar bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
he had his head mic like i &apos;ve got .
and i was approached by a nice young man called tim berners-lee who said , &quot; are you ian ritchie ? &quot; and i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
started a website back in 2005 , with a few friends of mine , called reddit.com .
so , it went from about five percent , which was when this meme started , to 70 percent at the end of voting .
but this wasn &apos;t really out of altruism . this was just out of interest in doing something cool .
but my father wanted me to learn how to read and write .
is this the reason why he spent so much time in europe studying instead of working in the field with us ? &quot;
i started to build a prototype like that .
they will do it themselves .
when i was a kid , i was going to school , i was coming back every holiday to gando .
voice : system ready . acquiring image .
joker : presenting my pogo stick.mt : ah . watch out .
and if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size of the american economy , and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy .
okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about china knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
you may remember what the chinese constitutional proposition was .
so the question is , why ?
it &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west .
and secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
and the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
for 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
but mostly ...
go get it , girl .
i want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone .
it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , &quot; i was here , &quot; on the top of a building .
so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television .
we called the project face 2 face .
and most of them couldn &apos;t say .
and the army took them , and instead of bringing them to the police station , they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces .
you see that enough in the media .
don &apos;t you have color in france ? &quot;
before i start that , just so you know , each time we go to a place , we don &apos;t have authorization , so we set up like commandos -- we &apos;re a group of friends who arrive there , and we try to paste on the walls .
for example , we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get .
that &apos;s rio .
and this starts right now .
secondly , population growth and density into cities .
they picked these sexy cars .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
so in this way , i think that cities are platforms , and certainly detroit is a platform .
so a lot of what we see in the mesh , and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define , refine and scale .
and this change is getting more rapid .
our mobile phones are more powerful than the total apollo space engine .
so forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
we have to develop a new way of managing the planet , collectively , through collective wisdom .
all my seniors knew me . i felt really special .
i went to the place where his helicopter was about to land .
he invited me to his studio . he said , &quot; come and visit . &quot;
but i had one problem , my paintings never danced .
and these guys paint humongous paintings , and they look really good .
so what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it .
and i was devastated .
i talked about this masculinity that one need not perform .
you know , i may appear to be a very nice , clean , sweet boy .
stephanie white : i &apos;m going to let her introduce herself to everybody .
she thinks burt rutan is very impressive .
or maybe stu just needs another backup singer ?
so let &apos;s see if einstein will sing &quot; happy birthday &quot; to al gore .
e : oink , oink , oink .
this is tim ferriss circa 1979 a.d. age two .
that is when i realized that i was not the incredible hulk .
so here are the new rules of swimming , if any of you are afraid of swimming , or not good at it .
incorrect , above , which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you .
i met my host family . things went quite well i think , all things considered .
i ended up being able to read asahi shinbu , asahi newspaper , about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later -- and went from japanese i to japanese vi .
she comes up , and this was her approach , the teacher .
thirdly , variation in tempo .
sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
and so we try to ask : what kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in , not fighting to stay out ?
it spread almost entirely through word of mouth , virally , across teachers , parents , people involved in education .
and connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the shephelah , which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west , and you can follow the shephelah , go through the shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains .
and saul has no choice . he &apos;s got no one else who &apos;s come forward .
and there &apos;s artillery , and artillery are archers , but , more importantly , slingers .
so here he is , this shepherd , experienced in the use of a devastating weapon , up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat .
the first one was in 1960 in the indiana medical journal , and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for goliath &apos;s height .
what they didn &apos;t understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness .
so , unfortunately or not surprisingly , most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens .
and so i started a collaboration with this person , michael zasloff and thomas fishbein , to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient .
there &apos;s a project going on at uc davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat , prevent , necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants .
we can &apos;t see it most of the time . it &apos;s invisible .
so yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was .
so we &apos;re doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly , so it &apos;s really gotten to be a huge thing .
the real struggle is not between the right and the left -- that &apos;s where most people assume -- but it &apos;s between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks .
so my page is on quite a few volunteers &apos; watch lists , because it is sometimes vandalized .
most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software .
rick kay is a very famous wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism , hoaxes and votes for deletion .
they always think they &apos;ve got 40,000 members when they &apos;ve got 18 .
and that &apos;s a much bigger project ; it &apos;s going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition .
they sing for love , they dance for love , they compose poems and stories about love .
i am told you will leave me here .
wild is love .
moreover , this brain circuit for reward is working , and you &apos;re feeling intense energy , intense focus , intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life &apos;s greatest prize .
there are over eight words for what they call &quot; animal favoritism : &quot; selective proceptivity , mate choice , female choice , sexual choice .
no , they &apos;ve never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship .
i think , for millions of years , men faced their enemies , they sat side by side with friends .
where ? the rooftop of my apartment building , a place where 96 families call home .
this is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
and they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows , but at night , they go off the edge and hunt in deep water .
and this is the best-studied sound , because it &apos;s easy to measure , really , and you &apos;d find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting , for example .
now , it &apos;s important to remember that you &apos;re only hearing the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds , and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds , and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds .
but we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard .
this is a scarf toy , and i &apos;m trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal .
now , will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally ?
it &apos;s a &quot; feel the fear and do it anyway &quot; kind of thing .
he is down . is he flying ?
how did you start to become jetman ?
and up i climb , i turn .
two parachutes .
people have died trying to do this kind of thing .
so just as a curiosity , where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon ?
and i hope it will be for everybody .
they even arrived at answers , such as myths , that dominated their lives , yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth .
but , from the outset , it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it .
&quot; ah ! &quot; say creationists .
so if the ancient greeks had only known that australia is at its warmest when demeter is at her saddest , they &apos;d have known that their theory is false .
if they &apos;d been observed in phase , the theory would have been refuted .
now , unfortunately , there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly .
okay , i &apos;ve made the glasses to my prescription and ...
what we &apos;ve done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university .
to understand this , i think it kind of makes sense to look where we &apos;ve come from .
so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe .
so digging deeper into this with the science and technology council of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery .
all of my time was spent outside with the inuit , playing .
please enjoy .
and in the last four or five years , we &apos;re finding dead bears popping up all over the place .
it acts like the soil in a garden . it &apos;s an inverted garden .
this whale could have been born around the start of the industrial revolution .
they &apos;re also big .
but he was right .
so realizing i couldn &apos;t catch swimming penguins , she &apos;d get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me , bobbing like this , and she &apos;d let them go .
what had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me , and she did that to threat display .
great . double-check .
so frank is sitting at a desk .
hi , sir , could you stand up for me , please ? just right where you are .
one time a guy had a hole in his pocket , and that was rather traumatizing for me .
while you were watching this , i couldn &apos;t quite get your watch off . it was difficult .
can i show them what that is ? that &apos;s rather bizarre . is this yours , sir ?
apollo robbins : the art of misdirection
all the while , we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow ushahidi and supported us in those early days .
guess how much it costs to call rwanda , ghana , nigeria ?
it &apos;s built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have internet connectivity even in very remote areas .
in the past , before air conditioning , we had thick walls .
and what it basically implies is that , in houses now , we don &apos;t need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things , as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building .
if you know about this trait , you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior .
we think they must be blinded by religion , or by simple stupidity .
the first one is harm / care .
food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays , and a lot of it is ideas about purity , about what you &apos;re willing to touch , or put into your body .
i &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
but the &apos; 60s inevitably gives way to the &apos; 70s , where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more .
i think that &apos;s probably right , although this is a controversial issue .
if you &apos;re high in openness to experience , revolution is good , it &apos;s change , it &apos;s fun .
but before you feel superior to george bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?
jonathan haidt : the moral roots of liberals and conservatives
situation &apos;s a little bit different where perhaps they know someone who &apos;s hostile , where they &apos;ve got someone shooting at them or doing something else that &apos;s clearly hostile , throwing rocks , whatever .
and since we &apos;ve already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways , i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .
so it wasn &apos;t that queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on .
and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas .
she wasn &apos;t violent .
because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are .
but he &apos;s trying to power it , or motorize it , with a drill .
i don &apos;t know if this is called a basket-bra , but it ought to be something like that .
they &apos;re a little bit radical .
his mother gave him a part of the garage , and he collected things from yard sales , and he made stuff .
and when someone opens your mailbox , you get a notification , an alert message goes to your iphone .
makers are a source of innovation , and i think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry .
sex tips are not glamorous .
well of course , in the 20th century , glamour came to have this different meaning associated with hollywood .
and i think that that &apos;s starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is .
the less experience we have with them , the more glamorous they are .
how do you create the sense of transcendence , the sense of evoking a perfect world ?
and of course glass block has that sense of translucence .
i could do a whole talk on &quot; the matrix &quot; and glamour .
she &apos;s very glamorous but , you know , she invented spread-spectrum technology .
it was a way of keeping my head attached .
if i was afraid , i went to more dangerous places .
i heard stories that got inside my body .
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world .
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick .
it was all these things .
obviously the whole project here is huge .
and ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest .
which sandwich is he going to take ?
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
now she thinks the powder is sugar .
okay , so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain .
so , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about tms .
that &apos;s a great answer . rebecca saxe , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call , doesn &apos;t it , to alert us to the fact that we &apos;re hurrying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nub of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and in this , towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy .
we fill our head with distraction , with busyness , so that we don &apos;t have to ask , am i well ? am i happy ? are my children growing up right ?
and the upshot of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier , healthier , more productive than i ever have .
and so i &apos;ll take you to wichita , kansas , where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site , right downtown by the river .
and the bike route &apos;s going right through the building , so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building .
we are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people ; we &apos;re about to embark on that .
just cut the whole museum through the mountain -- enter from one side of the mountain , come out on the other side of the mountain -- and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers .
and so it goes .
so the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
and at some point , christian will introduce this note .
and the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micromanage in jazz .
greetings to all of you from pakistan .
my heart and drum beat as one .
the maldives , as i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware , are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of india here .
picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean .
they are very good fliers , but they don &apos;t go too far .
but i asked some maldivian friends and colleagues , and yes they come every year .
those of you who grew up in india , do you remember in your childhood , dragonflies , swarms of dragonflies ? maybe at school , maybe tying little bits of string onto them ?
when do you see the dragonflies appear ?
and that sort of gives the impression you &apos;ve got one air mass going up and down , up and down . it doesn &apos;t work like that .
they &apos;re up , and they &apos;re off .
when those guys , they &apos;ll lay their eggs now .
there is more to the story .
this fellow is a very nice bird , this is the pied cuckoo .
as a kid , i grew up on a farm in florida , and i did what most little kids do .
the other thing that i had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks .
this ? it goes every which way . it &apos;s like a cartoon , the falls , and that &apos;s what i love the most about it .
here . back foot , back foot . okay , up there ?
not authorized , but not illegal .
in fact , winning isn &apos;t the word . i won it once .
and so i thought i would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era .
and what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object , visually sight the target , because they &apos;re in the plexiglas cone of the bomber , and then they plug in the altitude of the plane , the speed of the plane , the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target .
and the box is handcuffed to one of the guards .
well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant ?
zero , not a single one .
we think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that .
you walk down the street in any big city , you travel like that , and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species .
what we &apos;re asking about though is human ancestry .
but based on what data ?
now multiply it by 100 .
but what &apos;s even more amazing is that if you look at the y-chromosome side , the male side of the story , the y-chromosome adam only lived around 60,000 years ago .
if you think about antarctica , it &apos;s technically a desert , it gets so little precipitation .
an early coastal migration along the south coast of asia , leaving africa around 60,000 years ago , reaching australia very rapidly , by 50,000 years ago .
it has three core components . obviously , science is a big part of it .
yes , it is a scrambled egg .
each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe .
that &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
and what starts happening is that , around young suns , young stars , all these elements combine , they swirl around , the energy of the star stirs them around , they form particles , they form snowflakes , they form little dust motes , they form rocks , they form asteroids , and eventually , they form planets and moons .
now , where do you find such goldilocks conditions ?
for most of that time of life on earth , living organisms have been relatively simple -- single cells .
it &apos;s what makes us different .
we &apos;re burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years .
these losses , they feel , emotionally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . &quot;
and that &apos;s what i really want to focus on today .
we have one person -- well , actually we &apos;re going to slice him in half because it &apos;s less than one percent .
let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia .
therefore , 99 percent of people are organ donors .
it &apos;s a lot more fun to spend now .
saving more today is not an option .
one last question : how many of you feel comfortable that as you &apos;re planning for retirement you have a really solid plan when you &apos;re going to retire , when you &apos;re going to claim social security benefits , what lifestyle to expect , how much to spend every month so you &apos;re not going to run out of money ?
so thank you .
i want to talk to ...
and i said , &quot; i think she &apos;s dancing . &quot;
it &apos;s a symbolic gesture . i tear up the script , i go and i panic myself , i get scared .
get out of it , get it out .
there was a woodcutter who &apos;s about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood , and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax .
a film tells a story .
and the two divine people fought , and the gods were on the side of divinity .
bess : yes , my lady .
shekhar kapur : so , what am i trying to do here ?
and an idea started to develop .
the universe is a contradiction .
i got a scholarship , went to university , studied international agriculture , studied anthropology , and decided i was going to give back .
he said , &quot; okay . &quot;
okay . fast forward .
there &apos;s very good evidence -- again , we don &apos;t necessarily have a peer-reviewed methodology that &apos;s bulletproof yet -- but there &apos;s very good evidence that the average cat in europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average african .
the average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the u.s .
we need greenpeace to work with wwf .
we lined them up side-by-side , and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those .
we eventually got , i think , 60 percent of global production at the table and 25 percent of demand at the table .
if cargill makes a decision , the entire palm oil industry moves , or at least 40 or 50 percent of it .
this is the subsidy from nature .
and when you go home , think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better . &quot;
it turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion .
we insisted . we refined our paradigm , and after several months of training , the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand , and whenever she decided , initiated full weight-bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards .
me too , every day .
and i &apos;m honored to meet you , the future leaders of great britain and this world .
they taught me about what a strong marriage feels like : that it &apos;s built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other &apos;s unique gifts .
and that &apos;s important to keep in mind .
history proves that it doesn &apos;t matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate .
she is a world-class soprano singer who studied in rochester , new york .
it &apos;s called &quot; aria . &quot;
right . so what has changed ?
because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly .
so , for example , last year , the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .
and they came together to help find the problem and fix it .
it &apos;s reminiscent of the description of history as &quot; one damn thing after another , &quot; right ?
here is just a snapshot of some of them .
that &apos;s it . image removed at request of owner .
i don &apos;t know . maybe they think that , uh , killers don &apos;t plan ahead ?
so in the &apos; 60s , the u.s. was first .
and we see that in some countries , the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very , very strong .
all that costs money .
a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage .
how do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers ?
they watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling , and how they structure teacher pay .
but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing .
so my point is , there &apos;s a lot of struggle has gone in europe , where citizens were empowered by technologies .
there was a war going on in my country .
the question was , how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh ?
and of course , even if that &apos;s true , then what about initial buying power ?
and this is a business for her , but it &apos;s milk for everybody else .
and the result is , right now , this company is the largest telephone company , with 3.5 million subscribers , 115,000 of these phones i talked about -- that produces about a third of the traffic in the network .
we don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on .
and i will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in india , in china , will reach that of the west .
and i will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a gapminder graph here , where you can see each bubble is a country .
and then after the first world war , they continue up .
and it was deng xiaoping coming out here .
and that is not a bad thing , in itself .
growth is faster , and with projection from imf you can see where you expect them to be in 2014 .
you know the climate . we have great international experts within india telling us that the climate is changing , and actions has to be taken , otherwise china and india would be the countries most to suffer from climate change .
it doesn &apos;t emit in the electromagnetic spectrum . it doesn &apos;t reflect .
so these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now , we take a snapshot in a decade , it &apos;ll look identical .
where will this observer see the galaxy ?
and so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin . i grabbed a piece of graph paper -- i &apos;m a physicist .
ok . so now , let &apos;s turn to dark energy .
we call it dark energy , and it has this effect of causing space to expand .
and they &apos;ve put it deep down in an iron mine in minnesota , ok , deep under the ground , and in fact , in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far .
and i &apos;m robbie , and i &apos;m 14 , and i play the fiddle .
and you &apos;ll see , just now , a nurse coming back to the tray , which is their sort of modular station , and dropping the syringe she &apos;s just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again .
you load it up in the normal way . this is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .
and i think in that sense , this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea .
and one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active .
so by itself , i think this tells a lot about how people behave .
we have no consistent testing .
you can see that for the prevalence to be as high as unaids says , we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group .
so the data that i have suggests that if you double export volume , it will lead to a quadrupling of new hiv infections .
trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases .
while we &apos;re doing bailouts , this is what happened .
but it occurred to me , how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done , that we must have done it .
made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity .
organisms don &apos;t think of co2 as a poison .
this algorithm has been put into a software program that &apos;s now being used to make bridges lightweight , to make building beams lightweight .
there &apos;s a group of scientists in cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree , because they are saying , &quot; there is no pump at the bottom of a tree . &quot;
and inside those balls life , over 3.8 billion years , has made a lush , livable place for us .
to watch them move is a dance i &apos;m never going to get tired of .
rarely seen by the naked eye , this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment .
children don &apos;t choose a school .
because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry , and here i was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities .
now i was known as &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to listen . &quot;
government had no budget .
you will hear about it , and you will love it .
kiran bedi : a police chief with a difference
so this project started from the following realization : it turns out that approximately 200 million captchas are typed everyday by people around the world .
it gives you an image for every page of the book .
now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
so this is the favorite thing that i like about this whole project .
if you don &apos;t know any english , you can &apos;t access it .
okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
so it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
this is a sentence that was translated from german into english .
so the nice thing about duolingo is i think it provides a fair business model -- one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
the incorporated side , the company , is doing things that it does really well .
you mean all i have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and i sit back and roll it in ? &quot;
no reply . like , a huge proportion of them couldn &apos;t be bothered after they had just started , they just signed up , to reply .
all we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial .
i think that &apos;s a question we haven &apos;t really answered yet , but i think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences .
as it turns out , people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they &apos;re not .
matt killingsworth : want to be happier ? stay in the moment
and fortunately i decided in 2008 to return to ghana , after 28 years of absence .
the rhetoric of the candidates , of course , changed .
ghana found itself in the same place in which the u.s. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections -- bush versus gore .
and when surfers are out waiting for waves , you probably wonder , if you &apos;ve never been out there , what are they doing ?
i mean , fish don &apos;t know much about water , and people didn &apos;t know much about air .
and that was fine with boyle .
that wasn &apos;t an explicit rule in the meeting , but i &apos;m sure that was part of it , you know . if people hear voices , and they can &apos;t see and associate it with somebody , that person &apos;s probably not there .
you get -- you get , like -- i just had a natural feeling for science and setting up experiments . i thought that was the way everybody had always thought .
nowadays , it &apos;s no ma &apos;am , check your shoes . and like -- but then it wasn &apos;t -- they didn &apos;t have any , but the guy had -- i said , what kind of salts of potassium do you have ? you know .
we should have been , because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise , and it was powerful , you know .
you know -- and there is a lot -- there is a lot -- a lot has been going on since isaac newton and all that stuff happened .
and even then , you know , because the buildings get warm in the daytime , and they keep it a little warmer at night .
well , they found out in this study -- these two studies by two different teams -- that five and a half watts per square meter had been coming in from 1998 , 1999 , and the place didn &apos;t get warmer .
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .
i was really frightened at first , but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he didn &apos;t seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth .
there are more than 185 miles of tunnels , and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum .
i &apos;ve become more interested in capturing movement and texture .
the third question is , why is it hotter in summer than in winter ?
and we intercut it with , &quot; we are the premier science university in the world , &quot; because of british-like hubris .
right ? that would explain it , right ?
so , children are not empty vessels , ok ?
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
so as a chemist , i wanted to say , &quot; hang on . what is going on here ?
you have regulation ; information is transcribed ; catalysts are made ; stuff is happening .
so there are two options : intelligent design , direct and indirect -- so god , or my friend .
i need some information , and i need a container .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
you &apos;re sitting on chairs .
because the thing is , we are so chauvinistic to biology , if you take away carbon , there &apos;s other things that can happen .
here you see the data .
see here -- it &apos;s the best fit they can get of this point .
we have a decent trend .
and i &apos;m now giving you a wider picture than the mdg .
and here we got better education , and we got health service , and child mortality came down .
we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill .
there we are today .
that &apos;s why we must have that long-term perspective , but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods .
but the challenge is , again , they don &apos;t get much value , because they can &apos;t afford anything more than the scooter .
he said , oh , probably he is going to build a three-wheeler with stepney .
for example , that a two-cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft .
this is why you started actually a new paradigm shift , where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car , who were carrying their entire family in a scooter , started dreaming of being in a car .
a challenge , of course .
you know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
these targets have been achieved in india .
is it possible ? it has been made possible , by the way , for certain other different reasons .
i was also afraid of those 18 minutes .
that gave me a great message : focus and you can achieve .
my first app was a unique fortune teller called earth fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was .
when we design the app and we sell it , it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to , all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations .
this is a small modular reactor .
and these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees celsius , which means the higher the temperature you go to , thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies .
so i really think that in the , say , 20 years it &apos;s going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality , this could be the source of energy that provides carbon-free electricity .
and i think , i think , that looking at the technology , this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas , and you don &apos;t have to refuel it for 30 years , which is an advantage for the developing world .
then you can &apos;t help but make them go &quot; wow &quot; ; you can &apos;t help but turn it into a memorable event -- you can &apos;t help but turn it into an experience .
and there &apos;s no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience .
when you think about that , let me go back to what lionel trilling , in his seminal book on authenticity , &quot; sincerity and authenticity &quot; -- came out in 1960 -- points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon , if you will .
a wonderful book , where she talks about universal city walk as -- you know , she decries the fake , but she says , at least that &apos;s a real fake , right , because you can see behind the facade , right ?
so , understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future .
thank you .
the connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer , in that i love to solve problems .
and -- so the way i saw this in my mind at first , was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed , and the pieces would move far out , and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel , to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center .
and then again , this is a found object , a little fan that i found .
when i &apos;m making these pieces , i &apos;m always trying to find a point where i &apos;m saying something very clearly and it &apos;s very simple , but also at the same time it &apos;s very ambiguous .
one of the opportunities i had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the nih .
six weeks , these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart -- and then basically the development of the entire human body .
but i &apos;ll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world .
because this is the indication that the planet went into the star .
this is the spectrum of the sun -- 24,000 spectral lines , and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified .
you &apos;ve heard about solar flares .
and this is going to be an instrument to detect earth-like planets around sun-like stars .
because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems .
and we have some interesting cases , candidates , so on , things which we can &apos;t really explain .
and i was like , &quot; why not magic pixie ? &quot;
but i want to be able to make them not messy .
and so i thought , this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick .
in fact , i did it first in a four-day very intensive data analysis , where i went back , pulled these interviews , pulled the stories , pulled the incidents .
a spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown , but i assure you it was a breakdown .
so she goes like this .
having to ask my husband for help because i &apos;m sick , and we &apos;re newly married ; initiating sex with my husband ; initiating sex with my wife ; being turned down ; asking someone out ; waiting for the doctor to call back ; getting laid off ; laying off people -- this is the world we live in .
that &apos;s it .
we do that in our personal lives .
i &apos;m going to talk about how they &apos;re useful when we reflect , learn , remember and want to improve .
most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler , but the top is a very small gps transceiver , which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident , giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors .
this has actually been , to me , a gift , because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life .
and here he is , paralyzed completely , unable to breathe and move , over this time journey .
look at this , 2,000 people almost , on copaxone .
you scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs , but more than that , in the new version , i can look at this interactively .
so , how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system ?
i want to know now . can you help us ? &quot;
but almost all the time it works .
i mean , i didn &apos;t know what was going to happen to him .
there is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again , to be part of community again , to share of ourselves , to be vulnerable , and it &apos;s very exciting . so , thank you .
six and a half years later , a hundred and eighty researchers , they have some amazing developments in the lab , and i will show you three of those today , such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead , we can generate all the energy we need right where we are , cleanly , safely , and cheaply .
and it takes all the infrared available at night , converts it into an electron in the space of two small films , and is enabling you to play an image which you can see through .
if you do this , you get the last puzzle piece , which is water .
thank you .
then predictions can be made and tested .
the study went viral on the internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media .
in the next step , we built the network around these companies , so we took all the tncs &apos; shareholders , and the shareholders &apos; shareholders , etc . , all the way upstream , and we did the same downstream , and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes and one million links .
so similarly , the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes .
reality is so complex , we need to move away from dogma .
i don &apos;t just mean smart machines that replace humans .
you shake it hard and it breaks apart .
so i know you &apos;re probably thinking , okay , that &apos;s cool , but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment ?
and on one side of the bunk bed , i had put out all of my g.i. joe soldiers and weaponry .
when i first started talking about this research outside of academia , out with companies and schools , the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph .
because maybe we can glean information -- not just how to move people up to the average , but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide .
when they &apos;d come to visit me , they &apos;d look around , they &apos;d say , &quot; this freshman dining hall looks like something out of hogwart &apos;s from the movie &quot; harry potter , &quot; which it does .
here &apos;s how we get to health : we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .
in just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually rewire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully .
who of you grew up in a family business , suffered the torture ? yes , yes .
i made a desktop publishing system way back when , and that was , kind of , my first step into figuring out how to -- oh , these two sides are kind of fun to mix .
it looks like illustrator ; it can , like , draw .
and so began to have multiple pens on the page -- again , hard to do with our hands .
i did this ad . i don &apos;t believe in this kind of alcohol , but i do drink sometimes .
this is all at the same time .
and so computers , as you know , these big computers , there are now tiny computers .
it &apos;s everywhere on the beach , i discovered .
people say , are you going to bring risd into the future ?
for every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed , we have 324 boys .
but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can &apos;t roughhouse on the playground today .
anybody who &apos;s over 15 doesn &apos;t know what this means , because in the last 10 years , the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half .
this compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids .
all of those conversations need to be happening .
in her talk , ali carr-chellman pinpoints three reasons boys are tuning out of school in droves , and lays out her bold plan to re-engage them : bringing their culture into the classroom , with new rules that let boys be boys , and video games that teach as well as entertain . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and some elementary particles interact with this substance , gaining energy in the process .
this is tiny when expressed in familiar units , because it &apos;s equal to something like 10 to the minus 22 grams , but it is large in particle physics units , because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a dna constituent .
and the reason is simple : because wind builds up the sand , gravity makes it fall .
and i was also really interested in wireless as well .
you change its environment , and the object will flow .
we &apos;ve worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint .
so this one is like a sound board , so you can touch it , and i just love these horrible noises .
so now i have this collection of my friends i can take around with me whenever i go , and this is called animalia chordata , from the latin nomenclature for human being , classification system .
if you want to choose to punch that punch card clock , you actually age me .
still , we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we &apos;d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be .
that &apos;s real time .
while nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports , there is a huge underutilized resource out there .
you can either live in a world which is poorer , which people in general don &apos;t like .
but , actually , the point of placebo education is interesting .
i can &apos;t verify that fully , but it does not matter .
so , the modern equivalent would of course be this .
in the world of food we call it cooking .
it &apos;s simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions , and the very nature of the decisions changes .
&#91; unclear &#93; you just looked like you turned it on its end . but when you see it like that it &apos;s more interesting looking .
when i was 14 years old , i had low self-esteem .
i won the world yo-yo contest again in the artistic performance division .
because the idea was so simple , and yet it explains all design in the universe .
audience : must .
this is information copied with variation and selection .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s passed on from person to person .
they &apos;re using you and me as their propagating , copying machinery , and we are the meme machines .
we alone are gene machines and meme machines as well .
he wanted to estimate n , the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy , and he included in there the rate of star formation , the rate of planets , but crucially , intelligence .
but then , a long time later , billions of years later , we got the second replicator , the memes .
they &apos;re just information , why would they ?
but the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is , that third danger point , getting a third replicator .
aidg has worked in haiti since 2007 , providing engineering and business support to small businesses .
on his last job he was working with his boss , and they started pouring the columns wrong .
and the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me .
and then , like all good academic projects , i got more funding .
people now solved seven questions on average .
so , maybe what is happening is that there &apos;s a level of cheating we can &apos;t go over , but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree , as long as it doesn &apos;t change our impressions about ourselves .
a third of the people we passed it to , they shredded it , they came to us and said , &quot; mr. experimenter , i solved x problems . give me x dollars . &quot;
that &apos;s it . the task is finished . &quot;
and when we see cheating around us , particularly if it &apos;s a part of our in-group , cheating goes up .
i felt my intuition was correct . &quot;
it &apos;s actually managed by the network .
you know , reputations are built on trust , consistency , transparency .
which backs up my point and shows he didn &apos;t even break a sweat when he said that .
thank you .
you wouldn &apos;t think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another .
and if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension , you &apos;ve got a little wet rag .
it &apos;s a model skeleton that i made out of a piece of cloth that i wrapped around an inflated balloon .
so it &apos;ll be made of the same cotton cloth , same balloon , same internal pressure .
the traditional language is gaelic , but a lot of the music came from the gaelic language , and the dancing and the singing and everything , and my bloodline is scottish through and through , but my mother and father are two very , very musical people .
and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m in truro , &quot; which is where i was , and he asked me out for supper .
dl : what do you want to play ?
nm : it worked . dl : it worked .
self-study , self-exploration , self-empowerment : these are the virtues of a great education .
for example , pramode c.e. , an engineer from kerala , india , has organized groups of self-learners who build our computer under his good guidance .
so we collect your b pluses and your a minuses and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4 , which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are .
now , i don &apos;t know how many people here are familiar with the term &quot; mensch . &quot;
it would be great if the story ended there .
where does it come from ?
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
of course , they &apos;re all trained to work in warehouses .
markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisticated i.t. project ?
and there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators , and the key one is , of course , that the operators pay for everything , including all the interfacing into the public sector .
so it &apos;s small trades by small people , but it &apos;s very informed , safe , convenient , low-overhead and immediate .
with every picture , there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told .
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjoys it when mister putin turns off the gas tap , because my budget goes up .
but small atoms want to join together , small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron .
but fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you &apos;ve got a neutron , so you can make that happen .
and just down the road , this is jet .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
the signs don &apos;t look good , some have said .
the egyptian people , and many other arabs who &apos;ve revolted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
what this means is that human development , not secularization , is what &apos;s key to women &apos;s empowerment in the transforming middle east .
we &apos;ve also found an unintended consequence .
because i &apos;m not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals .
you should be nice to nerds .
they debated , should it have one s or two ?
this is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one .
but there &apos;s no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly .
there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe .
it allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group .
we think someone else , someone smarter than us , someone more capable , someone with more resources will solve that problem .
we didn &apos;t fly it into the pacific .
it took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly .
and with that exhilaration , comes a really deep sense of responsibility .
the question is , as a building professional , as an architect , an engineer , as a developer , if you know this is going on , as we go to the sights every single week , are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations ?
so on one of these rides , i talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden .
they happened in places like this , in the judean desert , 20 kilometers away from the nearest road .
and he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only , the slums and the state prison , where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there .
that &apos;s what perspective is all about .
and so , perspective and context and history play key roles in the way i plan my rides with the kids .
and that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world .
we can &apos;t hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity , of success .
&quot; because , thandie , that &apos;s not accurate .
for a start , we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .
because , hey , if we &apos;re all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life , then we &apos;re devaluing and desensitizing life .
and since , in the last 20 years , i &apos;ve developed a studio in london .
i was going to show four main projects .
so we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter , create one composition .
and the british government saying , &quot; you need to be in the top five . &quot;
and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .
but there was an underlying support .
so thank you . thank you , thomas . you &apos;re a delight .
but if you instead look at what is common to the world &apos;s cultures , you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world &apos;s 6,000-odd cultures .
whereas , if we &apos;re born with certain instincts , then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness , prejudice and violence .
but what i wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80-odd reviews that the blank slate has received .
and the humanities and arts programs in the universities , which by many measures , indeed are in decline .
but it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
i think that the sciences of human nature -- behavioral genetics , evolutionary psychology , neuroscience , cognitive science -- are going to , increasingly in the years to come , upset various dogmas , careers and deeply-held political belief systems .
and then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
he snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what i hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and i am not even kidding .
lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
and i heard him , i heard all the words .
i got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
i do , but i also start to talk about some of the other things i got wrong , some of the other notions of work that i &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
matt froind , a dairy farmer in new canaan , connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
but he looked at me , and he said , &quot; son &quot; -- he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , i love that -- he says , &quot; son , i &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
i mean , so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
i didn &apos;t know which of these things was true , but i thought it was kind of interesting .
and i got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center , which is where you get to meet the patients .
so i said to the psychiatrist , &apos; i get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls . &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; what else ? &quot;
they say it proves that i &apos;m aloof and grandiose . &quot;
although that figure rises to four percent of ceo &apos;s and business leaders .
he was saying to me , &quot; over there you &apos;ve got sharks . &quot;
and i said , &quot; shallow affect : an inability to experience a range of emotions . &quot;
i said , &quot; well they say that you &apos;re a psychopath . &quot;
he got into a fracas in a bar , he called it -- ended up going to jail for a month , which i know is bad , but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was , it wasn &apos;t too bad .
and i would add that bin laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy , or at least capitalist democracy , on the one hand , and the world of islam as they see and define it .
some people would say that islam means submission .
now , you may say , but surely , what we &apos;ve seen on television about saudi islam convinces us that it can &apos;t possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy -- namely , free political choice , basic liberty and basic equality .
now , i began with the war because it &apos;s the elephant in the room , and you can &apos;t pretend that there isn &apos;t about to be a war if you &apos;re talking about these issues .
and i could not disagree more .
penguins are very vocal birds and really , really noisy .
so three of those penguins -- peter , pamela and percy -- wore satellite tags , and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home , the oil would be cleaned up from their islands .
and was silvia gaus right ?
so if we each do our part , together , we can make a difference , and we can help keep penguins from going extinct .
we came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting .
it &apos;s about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what &apos;s growing there , because there &apos;s so many people that don &apos;t really recognize a vegetable unless it &apos;s in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top .
and we &apos;re just volunteers and it &apos;s only an experiment .
there are so many things you can do , but ultimately this is about something really simple .
and to my astonishment , when i began seriously studying other traditions , i began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today -- is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west , in about the 17th century .
hillel stood on one leg and said , &quot; that which is hateful to you , do not do to your neighbor . that is the torah . the rest is commentary .
as though that -- we call religious people often believers , as though that were the main thing that they do . and very often , secondary goals get pushed into the first place , in place of compassion and the golden rule .
and everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself .
so let &apos;s start off looking at something rather not-so-small , something that we can see with our naked eye , and that &apos;s a bee . so when you look at this bee , it &apos;s about this size here , it &apos;s about a centimeter .
so if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower , what would that flower look like , if the flower was this big ?
we don &apos;t realize it , but it &apos;s actually a record of that entire ecology .
now something &apos;s interesting here . this looks very different than any sand on earth that i &apos;ve ever seen , and i &apos;ve seen a lot of sand on earth , believe me .
and i do really like this shot , because it shows all the detritus that &apos;s sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers .
and i &apos;m sure ross can associate that with design .
so , still working with film , i &apos;m afraid .
but people do donate their bodies to art and science .
the lorry goes in front of it . and it takes slices of x-rays through the lorry .
if you look at this , just the tube , it is quite bright .
and i had a mac classic . and it &apos;s a little box .
that &apos;s what i do .
your consciousness , the you-ness of you , the me-ness of me -- that gets this one go .
i &apos;m very lucky , because he &apos;s better than all the other children .
i &apos;m sitting on a train .
does science ruin the magic of life ? in this grumpy but charming monologue , robin ince makes the argument against . the more we learn about the astonishing behavior of the universe -- the more we stand in awe .
maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
it is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
and then life was fine , dandy .
and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
well , he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president abacha , and it just so happens he &apos;s a convicted money launderer too .
he did business with global banks .
a recent study by the world bank looked at 200 cases of corruption .
after many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents , we found evidence that , in fact , shell and eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company , and frankly , it &apos;s hard to believe they didn &apos;t know who they were really dealing with there .
i &apos;m very worried today about this notion , this world , this prevailing kind of force of security .
you must fight anyone who encroaches upon it .
one of the amazing things that i &apos;ve discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species .
there &apos;s a young woman named carrie rethlefsen in minnesota .
real security is contemplating death , not pretending it doesn &apos;t exist .
when i start to pretend that what i &apos;m seeing isn &apos;t impacting me , and isn &apos;t changing my heart , then i get in trouble .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
pure content and pure form , side by side .
i was so wasted . &quot;
i set up the type , i printed it out on an epson printer with water-soluble ink , taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it . presto !
seriously .
not exactly jackie collins .
like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were a free kind of utopia .
we love challenges , but when expectations are low , trust me , we will sink to them .
and in case you don &apos;t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that cloning is possible , and that involves going through childhood again , in which case you &apos;ll want to be heard just like my generation .
when i began recording in the late &apos; 60s , the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like mammals and amphibians .
however , our ears tell us a very different story .
yeah . well .
and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and i flipped over right in front of the entire school .
this is one of my favorite ones here , where they have rabbit breeding , so males choose the lucky rabbit .
well , obviously it &apos;s for children , right ?
that &apos;s what the show looks like .
but if you were to go to a game developers conference , what they &apos;re all talking about is emotion , purpose , meaning , understanding and feeling .
today , after 20 years of watching tv geared to make me emotional , even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes .
i know violent video games make my mother worry .
there is a potential to do good as well .
some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great .
game designer david perry says tomorrow &apos;s videogames will be more than mere fun to the next generation of gamers . they &apos;ll be lush , complex , emotional experiences -- more involving and meaningful to some than real life . with an excerpt from michael highland &apos;s film &quot; as real as your life . &quot;
the way i think of it is , we can &apos;t learn to see until we admit we &apos;re blind .
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
that isn &apos;t what we usually try to teach six-year-olds .
and i &apos;m dropping a little dot for each one of these things ; they &apos;re evenly spaced because they &apos;re 30 apart .
and how shall we look and verify that we actually have it ?
and you know , i saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
it wasn &apos;t two years ago that everybody was talking about -- we &apos;ve found the holy grail of biology .
the first of them is the obvious one , the silicon revolution , which you all are very , very familiar with .
we &apos;re all identical to each other . isn &apos;t it wonderful ? &quot;
it didn &apos;t happen .
the first is that all these technologies are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen .
and to lose touch with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health .
so to me , it &apos;s clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology .
i have a daughter , mulan .
and i said , &quot; well , men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
that &apos;s exactly how it happens . &quot;
and i looked into this trusting , loving face , and i said , &quot; oh , no .
if your high-pressure hose pipe , or your high-pressure hydraulic line , bulges a little , you just wrap some tape around the outside of it .
happy , away i went .
raad mohiaddin , medical radiologist : we had to get good quality images from which to make the cad model .
we didn &apos;t only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that , was also had professional jealousies .
still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of episode , so that they can say , &quot; ah , i told you that was no good . &quot;
i &apos;m so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that i &apos;m not prepared to tell you what it cost .
there &apos;s nothing i can do as a cartoonist .
and it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application .
history tells us , they &apos;ve been used by the nazis to attack the jews .
people fear them -- they help the rebellion a lot .
but they came up with a book , looking back at 13 years of political crisis in ivory coast .
in a series of witty punchlines , patrick chappatte makes a poignant case for the power of the humble cartoon . his projects in lebanon , west africa and gaza show how , in the right hands , the pencil can illuminate serious issues and bring the most unlikely people together .
right after , i got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention , and with all great earnestness walked in .
and that will happen , paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit co2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet , and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful ammonites , leconteiceras here , and celaeceras over here , and so much else .
that &apos;s an 18-inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet , sprawled like a lizard , probably had a head like a lion .
so , if not impact , what ?
in this particular case , the source over and over has been flood basalts .
but the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble , so i &apos;m going to do a little thought experiment here .
here is a way we can get people to critical care .
so , what we &apos;re looking at now : does it leave a signal ?
these are the dark pools where global supply chains begin -- the global supply chains , which bring us our favorite brand name products .
this substitute cost nine dollars a pound , whereas real heparin , the real ingredient , cost 900 dollars a pound .
so , if we &apos;re going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case , in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism .
so what we &apos;ve been able to do is we &apos;ve been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain , that of the multinational company , and get them to do the right thing , get them to use that power for good , to deliver the key public goods .
go to the website . look at the audit results .
we have 4,000 companies who are members .
if i should have a daughter , instead of &quot; mom , &quot; she &apos;s gonna call me &quot; point b , &quot; because that way she knows that no matter what happens , at least she can always find her way to me .
but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
step two was the moment i said , &quot; i will . i will continue .
and i tell people that this is where great stories start from -- these four intersections of what you &apos;re passionate about and what others might be invested in .
but i teach spoken word poetry because it &apos;s accessible .
it &apos;s clear that when i was a child , i definitely walked through life like this .
the only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light .
their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism .
the reaction on the streets was violent confrontation .
it was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of south africa .
perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in bosnia and the failure in rwanda , when serbia attacked kosovo , international action was taken much more decisively .
journalism had provided a channel for people &apos;s natural sense of generosity , and the readers responded .
this experience raised a lot of questions , among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available .
the spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable .
and most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted , because they trust that the election system works .
and you shred the candidate list .
this is a very serious talk .
and the color now is the majority religion .
now let &apos;s see what has happened in the world .
because the death of a child is compensated by one more child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
i will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came .
religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman .
our bus ride took us from san francisco to london .
you should see it from the perspective of a mother watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly .
so , how we eradicated smallpox was -- max vaccination wouldn &apos;t work .
i feel like hank aaron . barry bonds can replace me any time .
the moment who says we &apos;ve moved to category four , this will not be like katrina . the world as we know it will stop .
you usually arrive right about here .
let &apos;s make it transparent , non-governmental , not owned by any single country or company , housed in a neutral country , with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent , and let &apos;s build it on gphin . let &apos;s start with gphin .
they felt pretty stupid , so they started sending in their reports earlier .
you can see my grandmother there .
and we had the rough , recycled toilet paper .
we &apos;ve got to think about the raw materials that produce our products .
that &apos;s about the size of germany .
and it was clearly totally unacceptable , so then you have to act .
search out the companies that are acting on this .
and ever since , i &apos;ve been walking the mystic path , trying to peer beyond what albert einstein called &quot; the optical delusion of everyday consciousness . &quot;
they &apos;re supposedly tongue-in-cheek , but they &apos;re actually dangerous .
be curious ; be conversational ; be real .
probably not .
paradoxically , when i let go of these objectives , and worked from a place of compassion and purpose , looking for excellence , rather than the results of it , everything arrived on its own , including fulfillment .
he risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he &apos;d murdered .
sometimes , when the war is over and all the film crews have left , the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar .
but over here , the heads of the dfs , mr. r.c. sharman , mr. a.k. sharman , led the firefight with their men .
we get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it -- which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information -- release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
j yeah . two reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
j not that we have seen with anything we have released .
you know , hero -- people &apos;s hero -- bringing this important light .
is it really yours ? &quot;
i mean there &apos;s like -- there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
iceland &apos;s a nordic country , so , like norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
and then i compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here .
this is the 1913 trio performing one of my pieces at the milwaukee art museum .
and as you can see , none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe , which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet .
and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range , but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens .
good plan .
and in fact , it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant .
but soon after , i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients .
but i want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids , inhalers and medication , the doctor turns to julie and says , &quot; why don &apos;t you go home and clean out your air filters .
they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way , and maybe censors that natural curiosity , or you know , reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .
so at the time , it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs .
poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art .
and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; but , aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot;
why did she say that ?
but actually , they were impressed by my words .
it &apos;s very complicated to explain .
so making a living is not that easy for young people .
so through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
it does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
we had to go back the following year , all the way back to the remote parts of alaska .
but some locations draw you back time and time again .
sousa was not a fan of the talking machines .
two farmers , thomas lee and tinie causby , who raised chickens , had a significant complaint because of these technologies .
for when you think of what sousa romanticized in the young people together , singing the songs of the day , of the old songs , you should recognize what your kids are doing right now .
it is now anybody with access to a $ 1,500 computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently .
so , for example , they can say their work is available freely for non-commercial , this amateur-type of use , but not freely for any commercial use .
i &apos;m working a lot with motion and animation , and also i &apos;m an old dj and a musician .
now speaking of trust , ever since i wrote this book , &quot; liespotting , &quot; no one wants to meet me in person anymore , no , no , no , no , no .
and that can have dramatic costs for us .
but if you look more closely , the plot actually thickens .
it &apos;s starts really , really early .
and these allegations are false .
we think warmth and smiles convey honesty , sincerity .
we tell very convincing stories , we slightly shrug our shoulders .
science has surfaced many , many more indicators .
and if you look closely , you &apos;ll see duping delight throughout this video .
so in this much noisier world , it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code .
there &apos;s been a lot of talk about narrative in africa .
and it &apos;s important to know igbo is a tonal language , and so they &apos;ll say the word &quot; igwe &quot; and &quot; igwe &quot; : same spelling , one means &quot; sky &quot; or &quot; heaven , &quot; and one means &quot; bicycle &quot; or &quot; iron . &quot;
if she does it again tomorrow , i &apos;m going to throw myself off this building and kill myself . &quot;
but also , the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt .
it &apos;s one that says , &quot; don &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s never going to be easy .
ghosts cannot slip back inside the body &apos;s drum .
and so when i come back from these trips , and i &apos;m thinking about development , and i &apos;m flying home and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; we &apos;re trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations , &quot; you know , coke &apos;s success kind of stops and makes you wonder : how is it that they can get coke to these far-flung places ?
so if sales start to drop , then the person can identify the problem and address the issue .
so if you &apos;re in an emergency situation -- or if you &apos;re a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it , to get to the health care center .
now , that played itself out in the world cup campaign .
you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn &apos;t be done in the village , and they agree to that .
let &apos;s look at a country like india .
so by next summer , we &apos;re sighted to run out of money on polio .
and this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
and when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
the abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
if you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
and i &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
it would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
the truth of the matter is that the titanic -- even though it &apos;s breaking all sorts of box office records -- it &apos;s not the most exciting story from the sea .
it &apos;s got tentacles dangling , swirling around like that .
this guy , that looks incredibly formal , in a way .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is a cloud of densely packed , hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .
dg : you can see , here &apos;s a crab that lives down there .
what they &apos;re getting at is that -- on the back of this crab -- the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals .
in it , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a habitat for a lot of different animals .
their plumbing system turns off , so the sites have to move .
david gallo : life in the deep oceans
this is really destructive .
but what you have here is actually four separate layers , and i &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
i like this question . it &apos;s about a water tank .
i &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
we need more patient problem solvers . thank you .
because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best , but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet , latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional , high-cost solutions , which depend on professionals , which is what schools and hospitals are .
millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
they &apos;ve been brought up by mothers who are illiterate , who have never ever done homework .
when you get to school , things are pushed at you : knowledge , exams , systems , timetables .
and so you attract people through that into learning , not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you &apos;ve eaten your cognitive greens .
and i learned it from this guy , who is an amazing character .
and that &apos;s desperately what we need again on a global scale .
and they all have the same kind of features : highly collaborative , very personalized , often pervasive technology , learning that starts from questions and problems and projects , not from knowledge and curriculum .
charles leadbeater : education innovation in the slums
that &apos;s when i got scared .
and then he reaches into his pocket , and he brings this out to me .
it &apos;s very , very frustrating , and i was feeling left out , like i wasn &apos;t quite gay enough .
all of which flies in the face of the gay agenda , also known as the u.s. constitution .
it &apos;s because of what the state of michigan says that i am that i am disqualified for any sort of adoption .
they realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood .
i don &apos;t want to romanticize aging .
as i diminished , i grew .
you can work to change your relationship to your past .
and if we can do that , it will not just be for ourselves .
so all the grasses , which means all of the cereal crops , and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen .
and here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic doesn &apos;t give it any nectar . it thought it would get some .
this , which is helicodiceros , is also known as dead horse arum .
and they get inside , and they get it all on .
and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light .
i mean , people cried . i &apos;ve never seen my mother cry like that at the end of monopoly .
so the ships start in england , they come down from england , they go to africa , they go across the ocean -- that &apos;s the middle passage part — they come to america where the slaves are sold , she &apos;s telling me .
it wasn &apos;t abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie .
we change as people through games , because we &apos;re involved , and we &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re learning as we do so . thank you .
see again , the diversity .
and then you &apos;re going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before , which happens right here .
i took the first 10,000 sheep that i collected , and i put them on a website called thesheepmarket.com where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep .
it &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot;
this is a collaboration with my friend daniel massey .
we made a music video for one of my favorite bands , radiohead .
collaborator two : it really allows this last recording of his to be a living , breathing memorial .
and this is called &quot; the wilderness downtown . &quot;
i worked in tourism for one year in mexico , one year in egypt .
so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english .
so sometimes i view from the inside , like egocentricity and the inner circles .
&quot; felicity . &quot;
you have sweatshops in hells .
it was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen .
you can also have function and form with public art .
they have a lot of scenarios .
we are a global organization . this is a global phenomenon .
we &apos;re told , from many sources , that anyone can achieve anything .
it &apos;s made to feel , by magazines and other media outlets , that if you &apos;ve got energy , a few bright ideas about technology , a garage , you too could start a major thing .
they own their success . but they also own their failure .
when we think about failing in life , when we think about failure , one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income , a loss of status .
it would be insane to call hamlet a loser .
here &apos;s an insight that i &apos;ve had about success .
that was fascinating . how do you reconcile this idea of someone being -- it being bad to think of someone as a loser with the idea , that a lot of people like , of seizing control of your life .
how could this have gone by like lightning ?
and when i said i &apos;m going to go out and do a 15-hour swim , and we &apos;re coming into the dock after a long day and it &apos;s now night , and we come in and it &apos;s 14 hours and 58 minutes and i can touch the dock and we &apos;re done , the trainer says , &quot; that &apos;s great .
and i had all kinds of counting systems ready there in english , followed by german , followed by spanish , followed by french .
after a couple of days , three days , you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways .
so that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
we &apos;ve got benadryl on board . if i get stung , i &apos;ll just grin and bear it .
so now what do i do ?
but i &apos;m ready .
in the future you &apos;re going to be checking all your vital signs , all your vital signs : your heart rhythm , your blood pressure , your oxygen , your temperature , etc .
now , how does this work ? well , there is these smart band-aids or these sensors that one would put on , on a shoe or on the wrist .
and this wired magazine cover article really captured a lot of this ; it talked a lot about the nike shoe and how quickly that &apos;s been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure .
who would ever have thought you could have your own eeg at your home , tagged to a very nice alarm clock , by the way ?
it &apos;s like a managed competition of sleep .
and this article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world : &quot; mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people , more quickly , than any previous technology . &quot;
and finally , another example : sudden cardiac death .
so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth , let &apos;s start with that . and since i got that idea , i &apos;ve had to shake hundreds of hands .
and arthur was looking at this old book , and he said , &quot; well , that was wrong .
and so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes , we can live 200 years .
so you see , it &apos;s almost like a pavlovian -- we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories , where you say , how do people learn how to react to a situation ? what i &apos;m saying is , after we go through a lot of levels , including designing a huge , messy system with thousands of ports , we &apos;ll end up again with the central problem of psychology .
in order to learn them , you have to go work in those restaurants .
so this is great for pickled vegetables , which is what we &apos;re canning here .
we used a red , very high-temperature silicon to do that .
here &apos;s a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue , or other radiant heat source , goes as you move away from it .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
he &apos;s got some seizure disorder . and you don &apos;t understand this .
and so here you see him doing a lithotomy .
the era of the &quot; big surgeon , big incision &quot; had arrived , but at quite a cost , because they are saving lives , but not necessarily quality of life , because healthy people don &apos;t usually need surgery , and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that .
and so -- i get to talk about robots -- the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision .
and in fact if you , or anyone you know , had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years , chances are it was done with one of these systems .
for the patient , however , it &apos;s transparent . this is all they &apos;re going to see .
because they let you keep continence , bladder control , and sexual function after surgery , all of which is generally fairly important to the patient .
jeanny yao : miranda and i are here today because we &apos;d like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries .
although they &apos;re part of the plastic , they &apos;re not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone .
we poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi .
einstein once said , &quot; you can &apos;t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them . &quot;
in some it is hot .
and charles just checking it out there .
you try things out .
this is the earlier design of that house .
and you can see why i &apos;m down on style , with a haircut like that .
ed : no , bud . &quot; d &quot; &apos; s right . at buddy &apos;s -- audience : party . love .
other things could have happened . the japanese could have discovered monterey .
it was always part of how they looked at the world . and that &apos;s what &apos;s really powerful .
and part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important , is that these are the ideas we need .
in four different continents , was depressingly familiar .
what it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave , is the absence of the rule of law .
bl : well daphne , we &apos;ve been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider .
they key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups .
we do not buy people out of slavery .
children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana , reunited with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become slave-proof -- absolutely unenslaveable .
however , only recently , due to several technological advancements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking .
well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their movements dissipate energy , which breaks the superconductivity state .
now , i can extend this circular magnet , and make whatever track i want .
and it was also inspired by this quote from douglas adams , and the situation is from &quot; the hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy . &quot;
but anyway , i got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to london on the train , and then was faced with the problem : okay , how do you make this rock into components for a toaster ?
and the last material i &apos;m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my toaster had to have a plastic case .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
so we updated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 .
communication technologies : 50 different ways to measure this , the number of bits being moved around , the size of the internet .
and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology .
this was in an area called wellawatta , a prime residential area in colombo .
for hours afterwards , the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the slum .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
so , i think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational , and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money , or , you have to pay for it to be good , but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands .
it is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being linked from one place to another , that being tightly linked in a group , is a very good thing .
that &apos;s the thing we have to fear -- is that we &apos;re just going to keep marching around and around until we die .
he says to me , &quot; we &apos;ve done some work around the country .
watch the fingers grab . the thumb comes up . wrist .
and fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it .
and so began industrial fishing .
and the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water , unlike light .
so for example , they found something which was sold as tuna , which is very valuable , was in fact tilapia , which is a much less valuable fish .
what is really exciting though is that the oceanic tags , or the ones that live far from the coast , are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes .
so now they know that , in fact , animals can live without oxygen , at least some of them , and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions .
now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of chile .
so we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them .
it fits into the environment . it is the environment .
what have i heard during these last four days ?
and i find that very interesting and very provocative , because what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions : directions that are specific and unique to problems .
i &apos;m intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the 19th century -- actually , in the second decade of the 19th century -- by a 27-year-old poet whose name was percy shelley .
it seems to me everybody in the world &apos;s been quoted here : pogo &apos;s been quoted ; shakespeare &apos;s been quoted backwards , forwards , inside out .
there can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn &apos;t affect the way you &apos;re going to move later in life .
now of course there are other moves , but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution .
so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is , for example , sensory feedback is extremely noisy .
but we &apos;re going to represent beliefs with probabilities .
and what it means is we really are bayesian inference machines .
any discrepancy should hopefully be external .
and based on this illustration , we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain &apos;s making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .
and player two &apos;s been told , remember the experience of that force .
and so it turns out we &apos;re so stereotypical , our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping .
so if i have to choose between those two , i would choose the right one because it &apos;s less variable .
daniel wolpert : the real reason for brains
we have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of mars . we understand the elevation differences .
why is water important ? water is important because if you want life you have to have water .
because on earth , almost all -- 99.9 percent -- of the methane is produced by living systems , not little green men , but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface .
what is the best way to unravel the mysteries on mars that exist ?
we will pinpoint where these gases emanate from , because we can measure the gradient where it comes from , and there , we can direct the next mission to land right in that area .
because we have tested ares model , several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years , under mars conditions .
so , these are the dark ages .
so you go to the container store and spend an enormous amount of money , and then you start this crazy sorting process that never -- it &apos;s just nuts .
there &apos;s a whole programming language and robotics tool , so if you want to teach someone how to program , kid , adult , whatever it is .
so , we went around the table to talk about what we should do .
i mean , why would you try to refrigerate a whole store ?
it &apos;s hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don &apos;t know how much this stuff costs . do you know ?
you know tom friedman says , &quot; if you don &apos;t go , you don &apos;t know &quot; ?
and in doing so , they &apos;ll save a million lives -- at least a million lives a year . a million lives .
it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country .
so , our call to action -- my call to you -- is for you to make going green your next big thing , your gig .
but recently , we &apos;ve been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight , to actually find ways to improve the world , to do something better , to actually fix things , not just understand things .
and there are different kinds of relationships between the people .
in the dotted red line , we show what the adoption would be in the random people , and in the left-hand line , shifted to the left , we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network .
and we did this passively by looking at whether or not they &apos;d gone to university health services .
here we are on october the 19th .
or , frankly , for advertising with all kinds of products .
just text us your temperature . &quot;
the building was under construction until the collapse of the venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early &apos; 90s .
while it may appear to be a completely chaotic place , when you see it from above , there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home .
in all these places i &apos;ve talked about today , what i do find fascinating is that there &apos;s really no such thing as normal , and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation .
when i asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground , they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn &apos;t have the money to buy materials , and this digging out was their most logical form of living .
but that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
and it frees up the nurses and the nurse &apos;s aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients .
but with baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
and as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
a surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day .
and finally , we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools .
we owe it to our children , our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along .
on april 21 , in the new york times , the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people had already been killed in the genocide .
there has to be a role -- there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity , and so forth .
now , what this movement has done is it has extracted from the bush administration from the united states , at a time of massive over-stretch -- military , financial , diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to darfur that no other country in the world is making .
the second is , of course , that at this time in particular in america &apos;s history , we have a credibility problem , a legitimacy problem in international institutions .
started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the &apos; 70s were wars of independence and decolonization .
or do you continue feeding the civilians , knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps , literally sharpening their knives for future battle ?
i want to wrap up , but i want to close with what i take to be the four lessons from sergio &apos;s life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing , which is how i would have framed the question .
at a micro level , the individuals around him were visible .
we can &apos;t rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen , for having respect for dignity , and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world .
will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades ?
in fact , what we know now is that every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger .
this message , this word , can come out that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business ; it &apos;s a brilliant way of saving your child &apos;s life .
many kids in the world can &apos;t go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal .
and they &apos;re starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village .
and we &apos;re seeing people transform their lives .
what i would like to offer here is a challenge .
so , that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle .
and that &apos;s about it .
in health care today , we spend most of the dollars -- in terms of treating disease -- most of the dollars in the last two years of a person &apos;s life .
you know , i was very fortunate to meet danny hillis a few years ago .
a neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here , but when you start to put them together in a complex system , and you start to see that it becomes a brain , and that brain can create intelligence , what we &apos;re talking about in the body , and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system .
so the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system , just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence , chemotherapy may work by that same exact way .
that &apos;s about it .
but if one is unfortunate to get a disease , you &apos;ll go into your doctor &apos;s office , he or she will take a drop of blood , and we will start to know how to treat your disease .
you know , andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel -- and andy was one of my mentors , tough individual .
birdsong , for example , is a sound which most people find reassuring .
or start at the bottom , and say what outcomes do we want , and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect .
secondly , make it appropriate to the situation .
you &apos;ll be in a massive headwind .
i &apos;m not going to answer that . but i will answer some of the more popular questions .
thank you very much . thank you .
astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air , food , water , temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea .
i mean , first you have to know that you &apos;ve got a problem .
just ten years ago i stood on the ice at the north pole .
but , there is good news .
with scientists around the world , i &apos;ve been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining , and drilling , and dumping , and whatever -- to search out hope spots , and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future .
some say 10 percent , some say 30 percent .
and you might have heard how engineers proved that bumblebees couldn &apos;t fly .
they &apos;re a great model for flies .
now , i want to get across that it &apos;s not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons .
and this is the work by eve marder and her many colleagues who &apos;ve been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many , many , many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis .
it &apos;s a non-spiking cell .
and so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble , and we make a decision .
but the real big step was the neocortex .
they are highly reactive , and they are super-plastic , and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us .
it &apos;s the same in the forest . every pine tree is different .
and we &apos;ve got the mathematics to describe this process .
and then when we zoomed into this , it &apos;s like a veritable universe .
but all the time i was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd , beautiful parts of this planet , i always thought in the back of my mind about project orion , and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships .
the people who supported it were the air force , which meant that it was all secret .
if you saw the 1959 ... this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment ; that &apos;s acceleration profile .
and one of the bad things that could happen to nasa is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out and everybody says , &quot; well , what are we going to do ? &quot;
so i said , &quot; you know , i really don &apos;t want to write about my research .
i can animate the lines .
and we are evolutionarily designed to do vision .
you know the expression , &quot; begging only gets you so far &quot; ?
but when it comes to us , we have such a feeling that we are at the driver &apos;s seat , we have such a feeling that we are in control , and we are making the decision , that it &apos;s very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision , rather than an actual decision .
and then they said to half the physicians , they said , &quot; yesterday you reviewed the patient &apos;s case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication .
now , a weekend in paris , a weekend in rome , these are different things ; they have different food , different culture , different art .
thankfully nobody wanted the dominated option .
and the question was , will ugly jerry and ugly tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?
do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide ?
in hospitals , they are security issues .
we have 1.4 million expensively deployed , and multiply that by 10,000 , then you end up at 14 billion .
and then what we have here is a little hole .
you also have a critical question now , and you say , &quot; okay , do i have to have the light on all the time to have this working ? &quot;
so if i don &apos;t want that receiver to receive the data , then what i could do , turn it away .
in this case , it was picking up bones and creating a tool , using it as a tool , which meant that apes just , sort of , running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool .
it is what makes you function ; it is what makes every organism function .
what are the exact instructions that are making it do that ?
for me it may be : every calorie you consume , you conserve , because i come from a very cold climate .
they have discovered pathways that create flavors , although it &apos;s very important to understand that those compounds that it &apos;s cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome , in our tongue , for us to understand and interpret those flavors .
and , again , this is , sort of , my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology : you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in .
nature has put a set of rules out there .
when he was a little puppy , he puts his paws on your leg -- you know , isn &apos;t that nice ?
i ask owners , &quot; well , how would you like the dog to greet you ? &quot;
so , at this point , the dog knows what we want it to do .
and this , to me , is always what training is .
and he was kept there by the owner &apos;s calm insistence .
i mean , who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they &apos;re screaming like that ?
this is how we go into a relationship , and it &apos;s hunky-dory for a year .
that is such a powerful training technique .
wk : yeah .
how much electricity ?
thank you so much for coming .
and there &apos;s some things you just don &apos;t need to have in songs .
very often when i meet someone and they learn this about me , there &apos;s a certain kind of awkwardness .
six is a tiny and very sad black hole .
if some of you play chess , you &apos;ll know that 64 is a square number , and that &apos;s why chessboards , eight by eight , have 64 squares .
it &apos;s a line from a poem by john keats .
the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange -- and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals -- but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
that is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
but i &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
they &apos;re always made from local chert .
the tasmanians were isolated .
and in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
i couldn &apos;t fit 40 million cups on a canvas , but i was able to put 410,000 . that &apos;s what 410,000 cups looks like .
and yet on that same day , 1,100 americans died from smoking .
i &apos;m not holding these out as being the biggest issues .
how can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us , and aid medicine ?
we took our chip over to hewlett-packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots , and this is what you see : you can actually see the strands of dna lying flat on the glass here .
and so we &apos;re getting unique signatures , a fingerprint for each virus .
you have no idea what walks in through the door .
everything that we could get out of genbank -- that is , the national repository of sequences .
and on day six , they basically threw in the towel .
and the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this , early-onset prostate cancer , was this gene called rnasel .
could be . and it might have nothing to do with cancer .
i want to go full spectrum and tell you how , in the process of developing this new technology , we &apos;ve uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as lessons for innovation , ideas worth spreading .
the process was invented in 1886 by a couple of 22-year-olds -- hall in the united states and heroult in france .
so to produce current , magnesium loses two electrons to become magnesium ion , which then migrates across the electrolyte , accepts two electrons from the antimony , and then mixes with it to form an alloy .
along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell .
our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges .
so rovs aren &apos;t new .
that &apos;s the only way that we could have done this .
and since they discovered those things , it really stuck with them so much more , and also they would experience their own failures ; there was a failure-based aspect to learning there . it was very important .
now once we mate , we click on the egg .
i &apos;d start dealing with tribes , cities and civilizations of them over time .
there &apos;s actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere , pressure and temperature .
and not only that , but also show the dynamics , and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find , maybe like in the hubble , at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales .
we &apos;re going to come back to that in a few minutes , and i &apos;m hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit , it could significantly change the way your life unfolds .
and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
i notice a couple of things about this .
physiologically , there also are differences on two key hormones : testosterone , which is the dominance hormone , and cortisol , which is the stress hormone .
when you &apos;re in the low-power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that &apos;s a pretty whopping significant difference .
people hate this . it &apos;s what marianne lafrance calls &quot; standing in social quicksand . &quot;
so i really struggled with this , and i have to say , having your identity taken from you , your core identity , and for me it was being smart , having that taken from you , there &apos;s nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that .
and so i want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
beaver dams , yes . hoover dam , no .
most people have .
and no other species does anything at all like it .
a virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude .
and , in principle , it could &apos;ve gone on forever , with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts .
and it &apos;s not our fault , anymore than it &apos;s our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven &apos;t developed the immunity .
starting with the simple tale of an ant , philosopher dan dennett unleashes a devastating salvo of ideas , making a powerful case for the existence of memes -- concepts that are literally alive .
i spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms .
i want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making .
so t is f .
now we &apos;re going to put that in the context of the music .
nicholas : : my name &apos;s nicholas mccarthy .
where there is no trust , the music quite simply withers away .
i had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers .
if you aggregate it , it &apos;s the third largest economy on earth , and yet most of these people go invisible .
you can &apos;t talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets , and i again give jeffrey sachs of harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life .
their women .
well , the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east , of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels .
we know that scientifically , thanks to the communications revolution , all the tribes on the planet , all 15,000 tribes , are in touch with each other .
that system , i call the &quot; third side . &quot;
what we &apos;re here to do is to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in chechnya . &quot;
let &apos;s try to get at the root of what it &apos;s all about .
now it &apos;s not enough just to tell a story -- that &apos;s powerful -- but people need to experience the story .
we then came to northern jordan , to jerusalem , which is all about abraham , to bethlehem , and finally to the place where he &apos;s buried in hebron .
and they quoted a villager who said , &quot; this walk connects us to the world . &quot;
what would the oak tree look like ?
if we &apos;re able to unite our third-side webs of peace , we can even halt the lion of war .
always a good start , no money .
okay . let &apos;s see if your shower in that house is working .
we arrive in the morning with tools , tons of equipment , trades , and we train up a local team on the first day to start work .
and we &apos;ll go a lot further than that .
as our aboriginal mate said , &quot; you white fellows ought to get out more . &quot;
how do we actually get the smoke down ? so two problems , and design should be about more than one thing .
thank you very much for your time .
just quick refresher , it &apos;s d-y-k-e .
our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us .
and it starts with three people .
and those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce , with plastic forks , and we get it into the cafeteria , and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers .
really scholastic , if you ask me .
but more importantly is my kids learned to get , they learned to give .
thank god omar knows that carrots come from the ground , and not aisle 9 at the supermarket or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam .
we take orders now . i &apos;m booking for the spring .
and most importantly , get the biggest bully out of schools .
we are growing our way into a new economy .
and then we put a lead , which is a wire , in the right ventricle inside the heart , which does the electrogram , which is the signal voltage from inside the heart .
we &apos;re putting in a copper stent , and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks .
we &apos;re going to send him the signal that we have , that says you have a heart attack , and we &apos;re going to send the signal to the hospital and we &apos;re going to have it analyzed there , and there you &apos;re going to be with your doctor and you &apos;ll be taken care of so you won &apos;t die of a heart attack . &quot;
christina sidebottom : well , my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like , and it was very strange .
we formed a company called neuropace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation , and this is a picture of what the device looked like , that &apos;s placed into the cranial bone .
and consider treating psychotic disorders -- and i want this involved with the ted group -- such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that , presently , is not well treated with drugs , and includes five million americans .
then there &apos;s a simpler one and , oh yes , i understand that .
there is even some from the u.s .
so you &apos;ve got a lot of information . that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m all for email and thinking while typing , but why give up old habits for new ?
does anybody remember these ?
imagine making it free , so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge , and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content , improve it , play with it , on a timescale that &apos;s more on the order of seconds instead of years .
ok , other organizations we &apos;ve been working with , uc merced , people know about uc merced .
right , books that might sell 100 copies a year , 1,000 copies a year .
the same type of mark-up , like mathml , for chemistry .
so i &apos;d like to conclude with just the last few points .
and at some point i &apos;ll even pass around what the $ 100 laptop might be like .
the parents love it , because when they open up the laptops , it &apos;s the brightest light source in the house .
and that &apos;s why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units in the first run .
and this year is worse .
that &apos;s the machine we showed in tunis .
and yet we count .
so we want to make it very much like a white volvo .
i would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs , but not the cyborgs that you think .
whether you like it or not , you &apos;re starting to show up online , and people are interacting with your second self when you &apos;re not there .
but then what i realized when i went to college is that technology doesn &apos;t just get adopted because it works .
and then , once you do that , you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way , instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in -- and oh , i have to do this , and i have to do this , and i have to do this .
hiv isn &apos;t like other medical conditions ; it &apos;s stigmatizing .
it &apos;s the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex .
if i tell her to take her medicines every day and yet , no one in the household knows about her illness , so it &apos;s just not going to work .
our organization , mothers2mothers , enlists women with hiv as care providers .
in africa , it &apos;s very , very hard to engage men .
i &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
and our organization helps women across that bridge .
those who are hiv-negative must know how to stay negative .
this is a really important process . it &apos;s partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in , and the synapses that are being used are strengthened , and synapses that aren &apos;t being used in that particular environment are pruned away .
so we sometimes laugh about teenagers .
it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development . thank you .
so what i &apos;d like to tell you about are four robot projects and how they &apos;ve inspired me to be a better human .
like , for example , what if it could go to a dinner party at the white house ?
it &apos;s being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world , and the idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame , but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious , like suturing , and currently , all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon , so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time .
nowadays , high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and i tried to build .
he had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration , and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status .
these were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being .
it &apos;s shaking me violently .
and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa .
and i watched young elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill .
but i think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
there &apos;s nobody i &apos;ll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years , so we thought that &apos;s a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight .
we only remember what we want to . at least i do .
this is a picture of my family , and that is netra , my wife .
it lets us create who we are , and curate what is to come .
these include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight .
sometimes i go to bill &apos;s farm and volunteer , so i can see up close and personal where the meat i eat comes from .
i needed to put it into a context .
it &apos;s out in the middle of the pacific , right around the equator .
you can see the fish are balled up and then there &apos;s a little cloudy area there where they &apos;re exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction -- events that the ocean is supposed to do , but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity .
they &apos;re also a country that is in dire danger .
and i was free for dinner , and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati .
many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this .
what they &apos;re not really doing is hiring .
so when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers , i start to think there might not be something so special about this idea of a generalist , particularly when we start doing things like hooking siri up to watson and having technologies that can understand what we &apos;re saying and repeat speech back to us .
you conclude , actually , that none of these things have mattered very much .
now , what i don &apos;t think is that jensen got extremely lucky and happened to land in the one set of villages where technology made things better .
now , you don &apos;t have to go through the trouble of reading them and i won &apos;t read them for you .
under &quot; arcadia , &quot; they showed things like this , from the edo period -- a hundred ways to write &quot; happiness &quot; in different forms .
they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version .
and other people go and fill them in .
and this was two weeks ago .
when we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves .
older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances .
changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past .
they usually love their grandchildren , and are eager to spend time with them .
but there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies , and perhaps to be learned from them .
these are clearly biblical archetypes , and the thinking behind that was to create positive , globally-resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that &apos;s using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message .
after a while , his advisers complained .
but this is not about religion , it &apos;s not about proselytizing .
i said , &quot; look at the eyes . they &apos;re your eyes . &quot;
and the 99 were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world .
dana : but i can &apos;t help .
now , i &apos;m a clinical psychologist . i &apos;m licensed in new york state .
last summer when we were in our home in new york , he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse . and i was in my office working , and he came in , &quot; baba , i want you to come with me . i want my toy . &quot;
and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that , and that &apos;s using our eyes more .
and the recent financial crisis , how much of this diagram might that figure take up ?
as you can see , there &apos;s a kind of odd , regular pattern in the data , twin peaks every year .
what rises twice a year , once in easter and then two weeks before christmas , has a mini peak every monday , and then flattens out over the summer ?
i already knew how to design , but it wasn &apos;t like i was amazingly brilliant at it , but more like i was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography .
and that whole thing -- it &apos;s two languages both working at the same time .
so if we do the same , we see a radically different picture .
it &apos;s a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space .
you &apos;re capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them .
and then will come what they call the heart , the lush heart note .
this smells of cut grass . now , this is the skeleton of the molecule .
this actually is roughly , in man-years of work , 200,000 dollars roughly , if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
now , i could do the dance of electron tunneling , but i &apos;ve done a video instead , which is much more interesting . here &apos;s how it works .
so they asked us to make a new coumarin . and so we started doing calculations .
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life .
received very favorably by business .
margaret thatcher was my mother .
a little break .
and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the devil .
by the way , years later , my social worker said that i should never have been put in there .
thanks very much . it &apos;s been an honor .
it &apos;s extremely time-consuming , labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people , to begin to piece together our past .
so , let &apos;s go to lake turkana , which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country , kenya .
essentially , his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved .
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence .
well , to end on a very positive note , i think evolutionarily speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end .
this folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it &apos;s growing constantly .
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo .
it &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you -- it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the exact same mold that this one is .
john &apos;s grill , which actually is seen briefly in &quot; the maltese falcon , &quot; is still a viable san francisco eatery , counted amongst its regular customers elisha cook , who played wilmer cook in the movie , and he gave them one of his original plasters of the maltese falcon .
and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
i broke five ribs on my left side .
the vertebra at l1 was like you &apos;d dropped a peanut , stepped on it , smashed it into thousands of pieces .
i had one arm in plaster , one arm tied down by drips .
but you &apos;re going to get home and realize how different life is . &quot;
and i started to ask , &quot; why not me ? &quot;
finally this guy comes out . he goes , &quot; hi , i &apos;m andrew , and i &apos;m going to take you flying . &quot;
and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house , holding onto the walls , like this , and mom said she was forever following me , wiping off my fingerprints .
all that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are , because we are all connected by millions and millions of straws , and it &apos;s time to join those up and to hang on .
dn design , nature , art . these are the three things that condition my world .
it was when i put the water in that i realized that i &apos;d put a skin on water itself .
how that flows through me and how that comes out is what i &apos;m trying to understand .
it shows how you make one holistic form , like the car industry , and then you break up what you need .
these actually are sold as artwork .
i have a big show with phillips auctioneers .
they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this .
i &apos;m trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
my guys go out for lunch . the door &apos;s open . they come back in , because it &apos;s normally raining , and they prefer to stay in .
overtime is the passion of design , so join the club or don &apos;t .
and the reason i turned out the lights is because i knew i would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence .
but you don &apos;t always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this .
it &apos;s also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off .
she always knows where he is , and she doesn &apos;t have to be monogamous , because some of these females come up with multiple males attached .
the primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships .
so now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators .
two-and-a-half years ago , i fainted from exhaustion .
it &apos;s my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals .
i mean , it &apos;s a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your peers is something different .
this is its first time on the u.s. west coast .
i mean , the question i ask myself , why does this happen in nature ?
well , i was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so i &apos;ve never seen color , and i don &apos;t know what color looks like , because i come from a grayscale world .
especially the aisle with cleaning products .
i heard a telephone tone , and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green .
i would encourage you to become a cyborg .
she said , &quot; life &apos;s too short , i just can &apos;t keep going with this . &quot;
we certainly don &apos;t want to give up the rights , when people do something wrong , to seek redress in the courts .
the fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up : &quot; are you sure that &apos;s the right dosage ? &quot;
idiots . a couple of years ago , broward county , florida , banned running at recess .
it &apos;s like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long , whispering in your ear , &quot; could that go wrong ? might that go wrong ? &quot;
so , how do we rebuild it ?
but it &apos;s a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the 1960s to all these really bad values : racism , gender discrimination , pollution -- they were bad values . and we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore .
so there is among many people -- certainly me and most of the people i talk to -- a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working , with the way our institutions run .
we &apos;ll see .
dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass .
it was a toy gun .
judge forer did what she was required to do , and then she quit the bench .
that is to say , it creates people who only do things for incentives .
he was married , he had a third kid on the way , he suffered from ptsd , in addition to the bad back , and recurrent nightmares , and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms .
there &apos;s a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged bankers -- i know this is hard to believe -- encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients .
aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness , and he was right .
and it was an extraordinary time , and i am going to go through some of the mentality that we -- that americans and the rest of the world were experiencing .
if you &apos;re born after 1950 , this is just -- consider this entertainment , otherwise it &apos;s memory lane .
it was just really , really frightening .
well , you need about 75 pounds of it .
he wrote many , many times statements to this effect : &quot; we have the right to kill four million americans , two million of whom should be children . &quot;
at this particular moment , we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities .
now , in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible , or you have to be on a floor -- on a high floor -- if it &apos;s a ground burst explosion , which it would be , higher than the ninth floor . so you have to be tenth floor or higher , or in the basement .
and shelter and place . you want to move downwind or crosswind for 1.2 miles .
i &apos;m not a social problem guy .
we &apos;ve been aware of these problems for decades .
how are those resources really created , the resources we &apos;re going to need to deal with all these societal challenges ?
but again , this path that we &apos;ve been on is not getting us where we need to go .
it saves money .
shared value is capitalism , but it &apos;s a higher kind of capitalism .
so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught , they do not have a cadaver dissection lab .
what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to peel off all the skin , muscles and bones , just to see a few internal organs .
we can see tendons and muscles .
he politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist .
however , in 1809 , david ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different , deductive method .
it was capable of iteration , conditional branching and parallel processing , and it was programmable using punched cards , an idea babbage took from jacquard &apos;s loom .
this is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends .
and he said , &quot; it &apos;s any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate and i said , &quot; really ?
well how would you go about it ?
and this was steen rasmussen .
by the way , this is highly accelerated , so it &apos;s like a thousand generations a second .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a poem or whether it &apos;s a mathematical text .
they have about 28 of these instructions .
you hit the viability threshold .
and the guy says , &quot; no , no , actually i lost them down at the other end of the street , but the light is better here . &quot;
this is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of zambia from a few years ago that i participated in .
the top movie of the year was &quot; die hard with a vengeance . &quot;
i had developed a process whereby i was the center of the universe of this technology .
they don &apos;t require any programmers .
physicians for human rights -- this is moving a little bit outside the health field — they are gathering , they &apos;re basically training people to do rape exams in congo , where this is an epidemic , a horrible epidemic , and they &apos;re using our software to document the evidence they find , including photographically , so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice .
and in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions .
and he told me , &quot; don &apos;t do that . go down immediately in order to slow down . &quot;
and after 20 days we landed successfully in egypt .
so , the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane , using absolutely no fuel , nobody ever could say in the future that it &apos;s impossible to do it for cars , for heating systems , for computers , and so on and so on .
just the fuselage here , it &apos;s so light .
this is not an airplane .
as another famous man , jerry garcia , said , &quot; what a strange , long trip . &quot;
and that &apos;s actually what i &apos;d like to talk about today .
and it &apos;s a feeling i can &apos;t ever quite forget .
you see , africa makes a fool of our idea of justice .
well , why aren &apos;t we ?
brand usa could use some polishing .
we can turn the inevitable outcomes , and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us , when you &apos;re up close .
and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast , there was muscle to the movement that started out here .
not only in lives saved , but in goodwill , stability and security that we &apos;ll gain .
and what we did or did not do to put out the fires in africa .
anyway , so i &apos;d like your help in getting that signed up .
please join us by working together .
communication is very important for ethiopia -- will transform the country .
elvis uses it , but so does shakespeare in this famous line from &quot; romeo and juliet : &quot; juliet is the sun .
silence is sweet .
researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries , and then predict the next day &apos;s price trend .
but before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor .
i love this picture .
but there &apos;s so much potential .
but a woman &apos;s got to do what a woman &apos;s got to do .
and i have done this throughout my work .
and this is probably something i &apos;m going to share with you in western media probably -- and how there &apos;s a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of yemen in one single frame : this is what yemen is all about .
so i wish that the world would know my yemen , my country , my people .
while she didn &apos;t have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension , she was absolutely emphatic i was singing my own obituary .
but when i needed it , it was a godsend .
my fingers started turning blue , and i was like , &quot; what is going on here ? &quot;
i still didn &apos;t want a transplant , but in a month , i was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles -- very attractive .
so my doctor got the ent , the top guy at the clinic , to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box .
thank you so much .
so a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes , premature puberty .
in fact , this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole , which blocks aromatase , blocks estrogen , so that if you developed a mutated cell , it doesn &apos;t grow into a tumor .
in part , amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don &apos;t have protection from contaminants in the water -- no eggshells , no membranes and no placenta .
p and neither had i actually before i started making this film .
and many of these workers have life expectancies of only 50 .
a teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream .
hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish , like cigarette lighters ...
small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater .
its species name is sequoia sempervirens .
think about this tree , rising upward into redwood space , 325 feet , 32 stories , an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time .
they don &apos;t seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do .
when you get near the top of the tree , you feel like you can &apos;t fall -- in fact , it &apos;s difficult to move .
to reiterate the point , let &apos;s go closer into iluvatar .
the eastern hemlock tree has often been described as the redwood of the east .
ants are not known to occur in redwood trees , curiously enough , and we wondered whether this ant , this species of ant , was only endemic to that one tree , or possibly to that grove .
and we actually know where brain came from .
i asked them why .
here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called server.exe .
we now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
here , i &apos;m looking at the hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
and on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in st. petersburg -- he &apos;s in his early 20s -- about his cat , about his girlfriend .
plc &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
what actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
and they have beliefs about what other people want , and what other people don &apos;t want , how much power other people have , how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want .
sally &apos;s giving her opinion to them , and they &apos;re giving their opinion to sally .
we need to know what they say they want , not what they want in their heart of hearts , not what they think they can get , but what they say they want , because that is a strategically chosen position , and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making .
how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two ?
these guys are all shrinking , the power is all drifting out here , so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel .
it would be a good thing if people paid more attention , took seriously , and engaged in the same sorts of calculations , because it would change things . but it would change things in two beneficial ways .
the system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there &apos;s a match .
so sony is generating revenue from both of these .
and i think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading .
it will take elders &apos; voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance .
mau was , in fact , gathering explicit data using his entire body .
and i am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them , as potent as the micronesian navigators , that are going dismissed , that this is a testament to brilliant , brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly .
i &apos;m the &quot; why &quot; guy . i want to know why you do what you do .
how do you make a change ?
audience : aye .
they tell us we don &apos;t have the resources , but ultimately , if you take a look here -- flip it up , if you would -- they say , what are all the reasons they haven &apos;t accomplished that ?
because that &apos;s about my lab . i &apos;ve had three million people from 80 different countries that i &apos;ve had a chance to interact with over the last 29 years . and after a while , patterns become obvious .
let me tell you what they are . first one : certainty .
and it &apos;s significant , isn &apos;t it ? so you want to risk your life for it .
leave my family . &quot; which he did . the time was one of the most painful experiences of life . my three decisions gave me a different path .
how may know somebody like this ? come on .
i &apos;ve been playing ted for nearly a decade , and i &apos;ve very rarely played any new songs of my own .
and we define ourselves by our gaps .
any dot can be clicked and expanded . and we see here , &quot; i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips . &quot;
the next movement is called mobs .
here we see people that feel &quot; slipping , &quot; &quot; nauseous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot;
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot;
it &apos;s called universe : revealing our modern mythology .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
here we have our star field . here we have our shapes .
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
what would that mean ? i have no idea .
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by shearing winds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly , and in the middle , in between , you get this undulating of the air , and if the difference in those speeds is just right , the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices .
the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data , terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information .
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; scattering of x-rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
and again , it &apos;s fully interactive , so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
so motts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor cortex .
i can peel off the layer of the lion .
so i thought i &apos;d start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life .
i counted the number of bricks and now i &apos;m multiplying . &quot;
but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved .
so , to cut a long story short , we &apos;ve explored this alternative .
now , this is 1990 , and then 2002 . and here &apos;s a projection for 2015 .
they said , &quot; go and do it , and we &apos;ll come and lecture . &quot;
the students don &apos;t usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m .
my understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot .
so , we were having a party , as you can see they &apos;re completely eclipsing me at this point .
everyone wants an aims center in their country .
people were really excited . they thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain .
how is the brain able to do this ?
in fact , they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute , which is called an ion channel .
that &apos;s the red path that &apos;s highlighted .
and then it also extracts movement .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that &apos;s going to impact technology .
so , this is a little tricky .
and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius , there is actually only one thing i really need to know .
and yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be explained by the starlight .
and the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole .
so , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
to give you a sense of how small that size is , that &apos;s the size of our solar system .
so , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars .
and this means that these things do exist in our universe , and we have to contend with this , we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants .
and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries , as have our preferences for them .
and every musical era had different priorities of these things , different things to pass on , different &apos; whats &apos; and &apos; hows &apos; .
and the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the scores , the codebooks of music , into the hands of performers everywhere .
what &apos;s the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?
you don &apos;t need to worry about knowing anything .
so turbines grew . and they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height , but they can &apos;t really go a lot higher , and more height is where the more wind is , and more power -- as much as twice as much .
and the spruce goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
but he wrote that for his wife .
and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind , because i don &apos;t -- i &apos;m one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted , so if i &apos;m trying to do homework , if i &apos;m trying to do homework and i don &apos;t feel like it , i &apos;ll try to draw or , you know , waste my time .
i &apos;m going to try to put that in some sort of order .
and so jon had a brilliant idea : he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube to create this dance troupe -- the league of extraordinary dancers , the lxd .
absent desire , not going to happen .
and , very happily , there &apos;s one class of people who really can &apos;t make use of this tool .
and that &apos;s why what i &apos;m excited about , and what i think is under-reported , is the significance of the rise of online video .
it can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print .
the world &apos;s ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide , and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine .
we can &apos;t stop learning at age 21 .
we have our own film school .
so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains , that &apos;s a go .
slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
but before i do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
here &apos;s the key feature though . these neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas , and i put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons .
one area is called experimental economics . the other area is called behavioral economics .
when methane built up , or carbon dioxide built up , or oxygen was diminished , the birds would swoon before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system : hey , get out of the mine . things aren &apos;t going so well .
and someone asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
local power , central power , now , people power .
that is already happened ; the information and internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways , but it hasn &apos;t , in every way , yet touched our government .
we &apos;re working with some of these people .
it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages , the intelligence of our public debate .
so today i want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve .
we had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices .
so it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection .
but this system would have an even more important benefit for our country .
so , three years ago , i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations it &apos;s a nonprofit , a community biotech lab in brooklyn , new york , and the idea was people could come , they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open , friendly atmosphere .
as a matter of fact , diy people from all over the world , america , europe , got together last year , and we hammered out a common code of ethics .
and the same kind of technology -- it &apos;s called dna barcoding , it &apos;s really cool -- you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga , if that sushi is really tuna , or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat &apos;s .
let &apos;s call it island networks .
so you tell me why , in our age of science , we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition .
you are a very , very , very bad person .
according to those same estimates , in 2010 1.8 million people died of aids related causes .
it &apos;s called harm reduction , and it involves , among other things , providing clean needles and syringes , offering opioid substitution therapy and other evidence-based treatments to reduce drug dependence .
and also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law , which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma .
you had water , sewer networks that allowed for this kind of unchecked expansion .
so we went back and started looking at the great cities that evolved before the cars .
we actually did exactly the wrong thing in boston .
i mean , architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time . what we need to do now , develop things that can scale to those 300 million chinese people that would like to live in the city , and very comfortably .
we need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration .
and that oil was used especially for lighting , but also for dressing wounds and other things .
sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s , especially after places like dunmore east in county waterford .
and most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface .
and you have to kind of reconstruct the path .
if you look at nucleotide diversity , which is more genetics that are passed on through parents , you can see that basking sharks , if you look at the first study , was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species .
so les did a finer study and he found out it came out about 9,000 .
and on one occasion when we were up in malin head up in donegal , a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail , more , i think , in startle to the fact that a boat came near it , rather than the tag going in .
it became known as simon &apos;s shark slime .
so you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark .
police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets .
another key story that comes to mind , which relates to this spirit child phenomenon , is &quot; the spell of the albinos . &quot;
you see a hand counting money just in front of me .
it was easier to get cannabis , heroin and cocaine , faster even , in the prison than outside the prison .
and once you say that is yours , you &apos;ve got to take it , as and when it comes .
the boxes are too narrow .
at sleepovers i would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
and this powerful awareness rolled in over me that i was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
my aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the lgbtq spectrum in any way .
visibility really is key .
is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
when i was a kid growing up in the south bronx , inner-city ghetto in new york , i was surrounded by evil , as all kids are who grew up in an inner city .
to intentionally harm people psychologically , to hurt people physically , to destroy people mortally , or ideas , and to commit crimes against humanity .
so they &apos;re going to put pressure on these soldiers , military police , to cross the line , give them permission to break the will of the enemy , to prepare them for interrogation , to soften them up , to take the gloves off . those are the euphemisms , and this is how it was interpreted .
so if you want to change a person , you &apos;ve got to change the situation .
we want men between 20 and 50 . &quot;
ok . here &apos;s the data . they could not be more wrong .
and secondly , we know there &apos;s no difference between the boys who are going to be guards and the boys who are going to be prisoners .
does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not ?
understanding is not excusing . psychology is not excuse-iology .
banality of heroism is , it &apos;s ordinary people who do heroic deeds .
to be a hero , you have to learn to be a deviant , because you &apos;re always going against the conformity of the group .
path three , you become a hero .
and one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do , for example , what you &apos;re seeing right now .
so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it .
so this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina , which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball , or , for that matter , a sheet of visual cortex .
the things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu -- for example , the whole management of the chemistries within our body are , in fact , extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason .
i promise not to say anything about this , except this is to frighten you .
but the novelty is here .
so i was born on the last day of the last year of the &apos; 70s .
jennifer baumgardner was wearing them .
so we &apos;re able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way .
which brings me to my third paradox .
so when i was a little girl , i had a couple of very strange habits .
my goal , quite simply , is to help people become more in tune with themselves .
and i &apos;m here today to share a new way that we &apos;re working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before -- humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours to more fully know the self .
in the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind .
here &apos;s an application that i created for the ipad .
so you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their add symptoms as they do it .
and from this , we can learn how to change the plot , the outcome and the character of our personal stories .
because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
and when i want to look beautiful , i step three feet away from the mirror , and i don &apos;t have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting i &apos;ve done all my life from all the dark lights .
and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture .
it &apos;s such a small thing , right ?
and that door closed .
and now i had lost it . and now i really couldn &apos;t see .
but i knew i would .
but as i was traveling here , you &apos;ll be very happy to know , i did use my white symbol stick cane , because it &apos;s really good to skip queues in the airport .
and the reason , i only worked out just the other day , which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people , you don &apos;t actually want to spend all the time talking .
the other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
so people who believed in psychological solutions didn &apos;t have a model .
it &apos;s proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments .
this is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics .
it could really change things quite significantly .
and the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong .
when you drive away , your car feels as if it drives better .
success is in the doing , and failures are celebrated and analyzed .
it also happens in , for example , cancer research .
three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments , and those trials were not published .
if i conducted one study and i withheld half of the data points from that one study , you would rightly accuse me , essentially , of research fraud .
we need to publish all trials in humans , including the older trials , for all drugs in current use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed .
but this our containment of the visible universe .
we carry that in us .
guitar hero came out of our lab , and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the mit media lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface , people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music , and playing it over and over and over again .
it &apos;s a real experience , not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms , but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group .
and here &apos;s the great baritone james maddalena as he enters the system .
so , the process and the technology -- basically , first we needed an engineering solution . so , you know , we have a firewire camera , it looked at an infrared pointer .
we asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring .
and odysseus does his best job playacting and says , &quot; untie me . untie me .
this is odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife penelope outside of ithaca -- the other one .
because it &apos;s not that easy to get rid of five dollars .
you &apos;re putting yourself , you &apos;re binding yourself , and you &apos;re weaseling your way out of it , and then you &apos;re beating yourself up afterwards .
each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement .
and what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .
and what &apos;s nice about it is it &apos;s not something that biasing people actually , because as one face smiles , the other face frowns .
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks .
x is the unknown because you can &apos;t say &quot; sh &quot; in spanish .
it isn &apos;t surprising , then , that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness , the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering , shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives .
it seems to me that there are five key lessons that i &apos;ve shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting .
and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern .
economics has become the currency of policy .
how bad can things get ?
if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits , you get a completely different answer , which is clearly conservation makes more sense , and not destruction .
but calculating this at the next level , that means at the business sector level , is important .
and i &apos;m delighted that the institute of chartered accountants in the u.k .
well i &apos;m afraid not .
they were fantastic .
they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pasadena .
we sat around and we talked about this -- we of course never resolved it .
but he was convinced of this .
he wanted to go out and do an experiment .
the only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very , very far apart .
and the way to analyze it was , of course , feynman diagrams .
extremely effective , it really did -- somebody said the word revolution is a bad word .
i literally drew on the walls of the trailer , mocked it up in cardboard , we &apos;d come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
they came to me and said , &quot; well , what can we do to freshen this thing up ?
there doesn &apos;t seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get .
pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness , which i think is a terrible thing .
even if you don &apos;t know what the parts are , puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart , and no matter how complex they are , they can understand parts of them and that means that eventually , they can understand all of them .
gever tulley : 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do
and then for the damaged arthritis on the surface , we did a stem cell paste graft , which we designed in 1991 , to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there .
and we &apos;ve done that . now we &apos;ve taken pig ligament -- young , healthy , big tissue , put it into 10 patients in an fda-approved trial -- and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill championships -- on his &quot; pig-lig , &quot; as he calls it . so we know it can work .
these rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years , and are responsible for much of what &apos;s gone on on our planet .
they traveled all around europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands .
so you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects .
we get to see a skull . but there it is .
my 44th patent ; about the 15th invention .
maybe if i hit the side wall it will bounce around the room .
and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket -- initially it &apos;ll be safeways . it is safeways ; they &apos;re trying this in three parts of the country right now -- you &apos;ll be watching tv .
all of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear .
and so , another way of hopefully determining who &apos;s friendly and who isn &apos;t .
and my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe , hopefully , make something out of themselves .
my current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that i still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on .
but all i have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and i can bring those words out of the background pattern .
i think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message .
i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me , something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was .
and yes , sometimes i &apos;m swayed by money .
the main characteristics of such a system is that there &apos;s one sole contact point to the ground .
with the same method , we can also get him to circle a person .
they &apos;re formed at the nanoscale , and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures .
now if you look at biology , there &apos;s many structures like dna and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you &apos;ve heard about that are already nano-structured .
and so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit .
we engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .
and what we &apos;ve found is through genetic engineering , we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .
one is kind of a place or a location or a room .
i used the software they told me to use .
i did the sleep thing -- i went to bed , i laid down -- but i didn &apos;t really sleep .
so let &apos;s go through a couple of those .
we all know this to be true , and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees .
so meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today , especially to offices .
so maybe it &apos;s every other week , or every week , once a week , afternoons no one can talk to each other .
jason fried has a radical theory of working : that the office isn &apos;t a good place to do it . in his talk , he lays out the main problems and offers three suggestions to make work work . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and we do all this -- and to go back to the original question , what do people carry ?
and the mobile phone , in addition , is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it &apos;s convenient .
you can &apos;t ask someone to do that on your behalf .
and instead of using that money to top up my own phone , i call up the local village operator .
but what i like about this is , it boils down to someone on the street with a small , flat surface , a screwdriver , a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge .
it &apos;s from a study we did into illiteracy , and it &apos;s a guy in a teashop .
and we need to learn how to listen .
what this is doing is , we find a -- a direct collision -- we find a direct collision between availability -- and what &apos;s possible through availability -- and a fundamental human need -- which we &apos;ve been hearing about a lot , actually -- the need to create shared narratives .
things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now .
and so these findings i think are really very powerful , giving many people new hope and new choices .
but i had always felt like , look , you know , i made the best choice i could make given who i was then , given the information i had on hand .
you &apos;re going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20 .
so if you &apos;re sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap , or company a versus company b , or should you buy the subaru or the prius , you know what , let it go .
the fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative .
text : relpy to all .
so it &apos;s been several years since i got my own tattoo .
the point isn &apos;t to live without any regrets .
when the tsunami hit south asia , the united states contributed 1.2 billion dollars .
but the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
we now have the money , given these low prices , to distribute aids drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach .
we have about 500 people around the world working in our aids program , some of them for nothing -- just for transportation , room and board .
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow .
thank you and god bless you .
at green school , the children are smiling -- an unusual thing for school , especially for me .
and you know what these are .
it &apos;s becoming a community .
the food is incredible .
but what &apos;s happening , our learning-different kids -- dyslexic -- we &apos;ve renamed them prolexic -- are doing well in these beautiful , beautiful classrooms .
it &apos;s a model we built for bali .
my tongue , larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected .
then apple released the alex voice , which was the best i &apos;d heard .
there was a reason for that ; it was me .
roger ebert : as you can hear , it sounds like me , but the words jump up and down .
i doubt , on that day 50 years ago , they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished .
we use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others .
you should never let your wife read something like this .
the psychiatrist says , &quot; all right , you &apos;re ugly . &quot;
after a few years , they had several newspapers in central and eastern europe .
and music has a rhythm , has ups and downs .
my bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised .
and i was very young then . i think i was 11 years , and i started asking questions , and that &apos;s when my political education started .
the bumper of the car hit my throat , slicing it open .
i had more than 50 surgeries .
so i had to go through trying to eat again .
so we &apos;ll just keep moving on .
and i go , &quot; i &apos;m just going to touch it . &quot;
so , the night before that duel , he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough .
but it &apos;s not just scientists who are interested in symmetry .
you see it already . immediately you go in , the reflective symmetry in the water .
what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same ?
and i &apos;m going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer .
the combined effect , the triangle ends up somewhere completely different .
and all the tiles match up again .
now , this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet .
because this one . i think there were a few here .
and the anthropologist randall white has made a very interesting observation : that if our ancestors 40,000 years ago had been able to see what they had done , they wouldn &apos;t have really understood it .
and that &apos;s all very true .
now there is something else , though , in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated .
but something else happened in the early 1980s , and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives and ibm , which made them , just didn &apos;t know what to do .
so many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters .
just by osmosis . nobody ever sits down and tells you , &quot; this is how it works . &quot;
answering machine : at the tone , please — beep .
so i know i went super fast . if you missed anything , i &apos;ll be happy to send you the list of these tips .
also , if i want to add something to a pile , well , how do i do that ?
and that &apos;s bumptop . thanks !
changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s a good job . that &apos;s interesting .
and if they do that all at once , it &apos;s like playing poker and going all in right away .
it &apos;s out of print -- still ...
and if these algorithms , like the algorithms on wall street , just crashed one day and went awry , how would we know ?
because the algorithms of wall street are dependent on one quality above all else , which is speed .
we &apos;ll actually part the water to pull money out of the air , because it &apos;s a bright future if you &apos;re an algorithm .
the fact is , you can do it all with one towel .
js : now , there &apos;s now a real fancy invention , it &apos;s the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out .
but that &apos;s just safety .
so , it makes one wonder , &quot; why is it there ? &quot;
and you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle . thank you very much .
why ? well there &apos;s only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths : diarrhea , pneumonia and malaria .
and rich men are afflicted .
bed net funding is up .
so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education .
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing .
now , the way the pay system works is there &apos;s two things that are rewarded .
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it &apos;s very bizarre .
here &apos;s a little clip of something i think i did poorly .
and with that , i think there &apos;s some great things that will come out of it .
julie burstein : isn &apos;t that a wonderful story ?
it &apos;s the embrace of loss , the oldest and most constant of human experiences .
it gets further and further away from the day , and light and seasons temper it in some way , and it &apos;s not that i &apos;m a romantic . i &apos;m really a realist .
and then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier .
and that was such an eye-opening , transformative moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact i &apos;d ever had on anyone &apos;s life , a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say , &quot; you &apos;ve been an incredibly important person in my life , &quot; was a moment that i didn &apos;t even remember .
and in many ways , it always has been .
it &apos;s done , it &apos;s out , you &apos;re cured of cancer .
so in 2004 , during my surgical residency , i had the great fortune to meet dr. roger chen , who went on to win the nobel prize for chemistry in 2008 .
the light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue .
some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others .
but i went ahead anyway .
we received commentary in discover magazine , in the economist .
you woke up , felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door , encountered new colleagues and had great discussions , and felt in awe when you found something new .
if we could turn them off , then we could try and figure out what they &apos;re necessary for .
and their neighbors , which don &apos;t have the molecule , would not .
this field has now come to be known as optogenetics .
and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .
and we &apos;ve now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals , we see slightly differently .
and the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
and now you can see , the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again .
buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us , and some that are bad for us .
and this is because we &apos;re all constantly shedding microbes .
if they hadn &apos;t been crowded -- you compare the loss of life at the pentagon to the twin towers , and you can see that very powerfully .
so i took heart in seeing that .
about two months ago , i had the great breakthrough -- one of my great , kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for &quot; steven johnson . &quot;
now , what you &apos;re having here is basically a global brain that you &apos;re able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it &apos;s thinking .
but what &apos;s interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .
it follows a power law , so that there are a few extremely well-linked to , popular blogs , and a long tail of blogs with very few links .
evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form .
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind .
&quot; pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
when the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions , it was these teenagers that fed the crew .
our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young .
that was one sentence .
so , as kevin kelly pointed out , there is no endgame .
we see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect .
and richard meier , who was one of my teachers , kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism , and he would say , &quot; bill , you &apos;ve got to understand- -- solar energy has nothing to do with architecture . &quot;
you know , most people don &apos;t realize it comes from the latin competere , which means strive together .
we have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing , and we &apos;re releasing this database into the public in six weeks .
they showed up in five days .
we then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .
edward snowden started leaking information , top secret classified information , from the u.s. intelligence agencies , and we started learning about things like prism and xkeyscore and others .
i love freedom , but even i agree that some surveillance is fine .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do , and since most , a very big part of the internet traffic today is encrypted , they &apos;re trying to find ways around the encryption .
they probably have a team building on thursday evening in a pub .
it &apos;s the war on terror .
and one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines .
a single country , any single country in europe cannot replace and build replacements for the u.s.-made operating systems and cloud services .
towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought , decision making -- it &apos;s the last to mature in late adulthood .
and each neuron itself is largely unique .
so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what &apos;s called an mr .
and from there it &apos;s routine . they understand where to make these assignments .
it &apos;s basically a large data set of information that &apos;s all freely available to any scientist around the world .
we can do that in multiple individuals that we &apos;ve assayed too .
and then we find some outliers , some things that lie beyond the cloud .
how can we begin to understand the way the brain works ? the same way we begin to understand a city : by making a map . in this visually stunning talk , allan jones shows how his team is mapping which genes are turned on in each tiny region , and how it all connects up .
and the gdp in africa is not making much progress .
we already know how to kill malaria , but some people come to you and say , &quot; you have your millions . how about bed nets ? &quot;
and in the 20th century , randomized , controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don &apos;t work .
so these are simple ideas , but we didn &apos;t know .
well , it turns out it &apos;s wrong economics , because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them .
if they get it for free , they use it .
well , with experiments , what you can do is answer a simple question .
so , why is that ?
it &apos;s not going to be easy .
go for it ! the worst .
because nelson mandela , as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of south africa , faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos .
a satellite picture looking down at the earth .
zambia : from 2004 to 2006 , moves from the 18 percent in inflation to the nine percent .
headline in south africa : &quot; they have landed . &quot; quite ominous .
2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as kuwait , the same league as venezuela .
the banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation , from over 80 banks to 25 banks . strengthening of the system .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the standard &amp; amp ; poors , moody &apos;s and fitch &apos;s .
south african investment banker euvin naidoo explains why investing in africa can make great business sense .
you think this is just another day in your life ?
nature . beauty . gratitude .
and , i guess somebody thought they needed to do that .
rl : i think he &apos;s a great american .
the moment my eye shifted , i immediately started to change them , so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped .
brain magic . what &apos;s brain magic all about ?
how could somebody read using their fingertips ?
kt : god .
that &apos;s so weird .
do you mind ?
nicole : no .
kb : can you show us where ?
and i only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release , but only when you feel the pressure release .
you did it pretty quickly , but it went down , ok .
make sure it is solid , there &apos;s only one hole , and it &apos;s a normal coke bottle .
ok , think of how many letters in the title of his name .
go ahead , i &apos;ve no fancy assistants underneath there .
so , now you don &apos;t know where the spike is , and i don &apos;t know where it is either , ok .
kb : now , steve , do you think it &apos;s here ? yes or no ?
but if you were to guess .
she had two sponges in her hand , and then she had two tied to her knees . my mother was completely absorbent .
so here &apos;s my question . my question is , how come when people have mental damage , it &apos;s always an active imagination ?
thank you . anyway , we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol , and then we &apos;d kill or be killed , we &apos;d eat or we &apos;d be eaten , and then suddenly we &apos;d de-fuel , and we &apos;d go back to normal . okay .
i saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality .
baseline levels are near zero , without some stimulus to cause its release .
and they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
so oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?
now this is the same adam smith who , 17 years later , would write a little book called &quot; the wealth of nations &quot; -- the founding document of economics .
he said , &quot; i can &apos;t do it .
also , high stress inhibits oxytocin .
her mother was number two .
and they indeed also release oxytocin .
what they did was amazing .
how is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
there was no place to stay , so i stuck my computer in , i went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
sugata mitra : the reason i ended with the face of this young lady over there is because i suspect many of you know her .
we look at it every single day . &quot;
i got the camera angle wrong . that one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate .
because it was needed .
sm : so what &apos;s happening here ?
but that &apos;s not sexy enough .
but i want you for another purpose .
see , the closer i get to this antenna , the higher the note gets -- -- and you can get it really low .
it really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
the subjects i documented ranged from feuding families in brazil to victims of genocide in bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in india .
chapter three : joseph nyamwanda jura ondijo treated patients outside of kisumu , kenya for aids , tuberculosis , infertility , mental illness , evil spirits .
in chapter seven , i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline .
it also monitors the internet and instructs local media on how to handle any potentially controversial issues , including tibet , ethnic minorities , human rights , religion , democracy movements and terrorism .
it &apos;s rooted in a principle of retributive justice , or an eye for an eye , so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area .
something is said in the gaps between all the information that &apos;s collected .
and i &apos;m being told the dynamic .
and i &apos;m doing far , far less .
and i just couldn &apos;t quite accept that .
so there &apos;s always , always that huge -- i mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .
oh no , i don &apos;t like that piece . &quot; and so on .
this is how we experience music . of course it &apos;s not .
you know . i need to say something .
tom green : yeah . and they &apos;ve been dogging me for a year .
and so they &apos;ve come up with their own set of rules , the &quot; rules of the internet . &quot;
the story is , scientology had this embarrassing video of tom cruise . it went up online .
you &apos;ve had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .
cp : i stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .
christopher &quot; moot &quot; poole &quot; : the case for anonymity online
and that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats .
a predator . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
these are the tuareg nomads , and they &apos;re living their lives much as they have for centuries .
it &apos;s really a wholly separate radiation .
big , but less than half the size of supercroc &apos;s skull .
i &apos;ve talked about a few of them . we really need to take that further .
who &apos;s pointing fingers ?
those are the questions i ask . and we talk about ethiopia , and it &apos;s very important .
strange landscapes , scorching heat and mad crocodiles await scientists seeking clues to evolution &apos;s genius . paleontologist paul sereno talks about his surprising encounters with prehistory -- and a new way to help students join the adventure .
and the second time derartu tulu grabs her and tries to pull her .
they &apos;re trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries .
her uterus would be torn .
you &apos;ve got to be really careful any time someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer , because , it being prehistory , you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it .
they need to be part of the pack .
it &apos;s only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain .
and what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes , you get rid of the stress , you get rid of the injuries and the ailments .
cynthia breazeal : so kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child , which i assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind .
people use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is , how likable , how engaging , how trustworthy .
this is like , if you &apos;re familiar with any of the telepresence robots today -- this is mirroring that situation .
but if robots can be engaging , if we like to cooperate with robots , if robots are persuasive , maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program , maybe they can help you manage your weight .
and the longer you could interact with one of these interventions , well that &apos;s indicative , potentially , of longer-term success .
so here , nathan has changed the letter a to the number 2 .
i &apos;m stylin &apos; , smilin &apos; , lookin &apos; real mean , because it ain &apos;t about being heard , just being seen .
he made a left turn on houston , i pulled out my gun , and i said , &apos; gimme them jordans ! &apos; and the punk tried to run .
i didn &apos;t know you actually have to have creative control .
you think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business ? i &apos;m a suspicious mulatto , which means i &apos;m too black to be white and too white to be doing it right .
and this gets shown in art galleries like this , as a sequence .
but then this changed suddenly .
so a big disclaimer is put on everything that i do , and i made narratives about all the european or brit celebrities and comments about our public figures .
it was a bit of a road stopper , which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds , but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance .
so , i &apos;ll leave you with these clips to have a look .
and those are the times they &apos;re most productive .
these worsening indices of health care or health studies in africa demand a new look . we cannot keep on doing things the way we &apos;ve always done them .
we emphasize training , and we make sure that this process is regenerative .
look at mrs. jones . look at the study , tell me what you think . &quot;
if you don &apos;t get this pacemaker , you will be dead .
i think this aspect of training in cardiology that the heart institute of the caribbean has introduced in jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases .
you have to get away from verbal language .
i see only specific pictures .
and there i got a gigantic one , and the control over there , the blue one , has got a really small one .
there &apos;s a ton of information on that fire hydrant .
it would be their airplane tails .
it &apos;s kind of a trade-off between thinking and social .
like if a kid loves racecars , let &apos;s use racecars for math .
and i just want to thank everybody for coming .
it &apos;s worked really well . i get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world . we need a lot more of that , and a lot less abstract stuff .
wake up .
the shark experts are the best in the world -- large predators below .
and at this point , by this summer , everybody -- scientists , sports scientists , endurance experts , neurologists , my own team , bonnie -- said it &apos;s impossible .
and then we kind of have a cardinal rule that i &apos;m never told , really , how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
if she can &apos;t talk when she gets to the shore , she &apos;s gonna be pissed off . &quot;
all of that &apos;s great , and i don &apos;t denigrate it .
we served together in iraq and afghanistan .
they &apos;ve eaten together . they &apos;ve bled together .
a post that read : &quot; goodbye . &quot;
more media always means more arguing .
to a first approximation , the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay .
people would literally mail him changes that they &apos;d agreed on , and he would merge them by hand .
which is , are you talking about the thing with the singing cats ? like , is that the thing you think is going to be good for society ?
somebody put a question up on quora saying , &quot; why is it that lawmakers don &apos;t use distributed version control ? &quot;
clay shirky : how the internet will transform government
so you see , on the bottom , that rocket was supposed to go upward ; somehow it ended going sideways .
well , the way i think about it is fairly simple .
it has volcanoes on it . and that &apos;s mount olympus on mars , which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet .
and that &apos;s what we found out . it turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on mars , as you are seeing here , and when the dust devil comes over the rover , it just cleans it up .
that &apos;s what we call the seven minutes of terror .
bc : in the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute , we &apos;ll decelerate from 900 miles an hour to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour .
so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you , kind of , the steps we go through .
and i know many of you , kind of , last time afterwards said well , that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags .
and we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form , each one looking very different and very odd , and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this , and telling nasa we need more money so we can explain what these things look like , or why they formed that way .
and then with an instrument we have on board , a radar instrument , we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here , so it looks very much like earth .
now why am i telling you this story , and what does this have to do with the future of health ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d try that yet , but that &apos;s available .
oh , we might have missed it , but using a.i. on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before .
or might we be able to leverage today &apos;s gaming technology , like the microsoft kinect , and hack that to enable diagnostics , for example , in diagnosing stroke , using simple motion detection , using hundred-dollar devices .
too much information , i think , than you might need .
and i think by leveraging these sorts of technologies , we &apos;re going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability , or super-enabling .
put it on a chip , enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care , anywhere in the world .
so genomics , proteomics , the environment , all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians , how do we manage it ?
so i &apos;ve studied a lot about stem cells -- embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful .
thank you . thank you .
only later would i see the dresses also as a proclamation : that in your dim kitchen , your laundry , your bleak concrete yard , what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation ; your real sensual nature , veiled in those sexless vestments , was utterly your dominion .
a cry so pure , practiced , detached , it had no need of a voice , or could no longer bear one .
something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders i devoured in those days .
herself fall .
the girls , to my horror , averted their gaze .
c.k. williams : poetry of youth and age
samuel pisar , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot;
but images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
that was our hf radio antenna .
two norwegians did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it solo .
when the ice was flat or flattish , i could just about pull both .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach --but it worked perfectly .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sledge . did a sort of video diary piece .
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
this is probably why i didn &apos;t get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
every south pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -- no one has ever made a return journey . so that &apos;s the plan .
and then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life .
&quot; fantastic ! &quot; i thought . &quot; let &apos;s throw him out .
i mean , this is all very depressing , right -- people have conflicts of interest , we don &apos;t see it , and so on .
what if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination , something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself ?
now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name .
and then it was only later that i realized how very similar these questions were to the ones i used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night .
a good reader has an artist &apos;s passion , a willingness to get caught up in the story , but just as importantly , the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist , which acts to temper and complicate the reader &apos;s intuitive reactions to the story .
for the last 40 years , i have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -- old , aged , authoritarian , corrupt situations -- regimes that we have seen around us .
this is what they were telling . this is their propaganda .
always , we believed that change will spring from within , that change should be a reconciliation with culture , cultural diversity , with our faith in our tradition and in our history , but at the same time , open to universal values , connected with the world , tolerant to the outside .
he told me , &quot; we appeal to you not to switch off the cameras .
wadah khanfar : actually , this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered .
i believe they &apos;ve heard your talk .
and a small part of my brain is thinking , &apos; that is so gross and really dangerous , &apos; but most of my brain is thinking , &apos; please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me .
&quot; no , no . we share needles because we don &apos;t want to go to jail . &quot;
now , the ones that show that needle programs aren &apos;t effective -- you think that &apos;s one of these annoying dynamic slides and i &apos;m going to press my dongle and the rest of it &apos;s going to come up , but no -- that &apos;s the whole slide .
and that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
so , if you look at the viremia thing again , if you do start treatment when you &apos;re sick , well , what happens ? your viral load comes down .
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .
we &apos;re not all of them , of course , but ted is a community of opinion leaders .
and we &apos;d sing this old song . she didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so i &apos;d sing , &quot; hey , hey ! &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; black-eyed susie . &quot;
he said , well , you can go back to clinch mountain , where i &apos;m from , or asheville or mount airy , north carolina -- some place that has a lot of music .
you take kate , i &apos;ll take sal ; we &apos;ll both have a johnson gal .
of course , we were just eight and 10 .
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again .
after the -- she was glad to have a story about herself , of course , but after the concert she came up and she said , &quot; david , i &apos;ve got to tell you something .
on the list it would be stuff like , seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring , the smell of new-mown hay , catching a wave and bodysurfing , the touch of a baby &apos;s hand , the sound of doc watson playing the guitar , listening to old records of muddy waters and uncle dave macon .
michael &apos;s dad was working on something called the computer .
it became chris berquist &apos;s job to do the melting down .
we want to be in the forefront fields , and we want to do it differently .
and the idea is that everything is defined .
and this network of relations is ever-evolving .
and if you push that all the way down , really , it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational .
in that year , we are not available for any of our clients .
while in the third one , in the calling , very much likely i would do it also if i wouldn &apos;t be financially compensated for it .
it &apos;s not quite finished yet .
scotch tape came out of this program , as well as art fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3m .
and probably most importantly , basically everything we &apos;ve done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year .
like this donna toney poster , or chopin , or mozart , or la monte young .
and with the help of 100 volunteers , over a week , created this fairly floral typography that spelled , &quot; obsessions make my life worse and my work better . &quot;
so it &apos;s going to be a while .
and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone &apos;s participation .
so at funerals , relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place : its impact on life and the relationships of the living .
what would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it &apos;s so intimately a part of who we all are ?
and today is emmanuel &apos;s day , i think we &apos;ve agreed that , already , haven &apos;t we ?
and elaine morgan yesterday , wasn &apos;t she wonderful ?
thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not covet thy neighbor &apos;s wife . &quot;
and making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult .
and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday .
and then they &apos;d listen to demosthenes , and they &apos;d say , &quot; let &apos;s march . &quot;
&quot; i believe , i believe it was president dwight d. eisenhower who said ... &quot;
i &apos;m interested in how many are three to 12 years old .
and that happened for all museums .
so allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth .
so it &apos;s real easy to tell them apart .
nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .
so a colleague of mine at berkley , he and i were looking at triceratops .
and torosaurus , when we cut into it , has mature bone .
again , makes you wonder .
it &apos;s small and large . this is an ashtray , a water glass .
it &apos;s formless , featureless , depthless , scaleless , massless , purposeless and dimensionless .
this was something done at the cartier foundation .
and also the acoustic separation was destroyed .
the mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web .
it &apos;s like a coffin , it basically sends all the sound , like a gutter-ball effect , down the aisles .
i just didn &apos;t think that , in 2011 , women would still be in that category .
now , here &apos;s a secret you probably know already : your stories are constructed .
now , i know you &apos;re all distracted , so i &apos;ll take that off .
it would help to have more women in positions of leadership in the media . a recent global survey found that 73 percent of the top media management jobs are still held by men .
remember , a complete picture of reality may depend upon it .
with these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need .
and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn &apos;t been for saddam hussein .
and one of the things -- if you remember condoleezza rice was at some event and she wore boots , and she got criticized over that .
and therefore it means that we have to remember that , while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and pat , you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women .
but it doesn &apos;t mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women .
or &quot; aren &apos;t your children suffering because you &apos;re not there all the time ? &quot;
not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the arab spring has been , neither to oversell the role of technology , but these things have given a sense of what &apos;s possible when the age-old model of power , the pyramid , gets turned upside down , putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom , as it were .
now , the rate is still too high -- still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives .
we can &apos;t get this done until we really accept that we can get this done .
this is exciting stuff .
we are going to win because we have dreams , and we &apos;re willing to stand up for those dreams . &quot;
and there are a lot of people doing this , a lot of synthetic biologists doing this , like craig venter .
turns out i think he &apos;s actually a computer scientist .
so , you can go to a natural source .
so , they &apos;re all floating around in solution , and to look at them , you have to get them on a surface where they stick .
so it &apos;s very promising for making small computers .
you can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a dna origami , and when you add those tiles that count , they will start to count -- they will read that 32 and they &apos;ll stop at 32 .
if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it , the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory .
and i wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record , which i still stand by , but this has got something else in it .
since then i &apos;ve also co-founded two other social enterprises .
yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in , pay a fee , and fight the demand for a bribe .
for we are insane people , trying to do an impossible task .
if you can pull this off , you will be a global hero .
we &apos;ve got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east .
there &apos;s a talk about gratitude .
and all of this comes from the architecture of complexity , or the patterns of how things are connected .
the need for degrees has left so many people frozen .
the janitor &apos;s job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .
it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people .
but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing : &quot; we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure . &quot;
the lemonade story is one .
there was going to be a national referendum .
so what can we do ?
and a bonus he &apos;s discovering is he &apos;s actually going to make even more money .
someone is always watching .
thank you .
if it &apos;s the grape , they won &apos;t break it . &quot;
and i told them i &apos;d build them an arm .
he &apos;s punching our controls guy . the guy behind him is our engineer / surgeon , which is a convenient guy to have around .
i could give you fine motor control , or i could let you curl 40 pounds ; i probably can &apos;t do both .
it was astounding .
and he said , &quot; i had a truck , before i went over there , and it had a stick .
it &apos;s not possible . it would be nice but let &apos;s be realistic .
dean kamen : the emotion behind invention
sure , she had aged a little .
i was buried alive in new york city in a coffin , buried alive in a coffin in april , 1999 , for a week .
i started to think , if the boy could survive without breathing for that long , there must be a way that i could do it .
which was another insane idea , obviously .
every morning , this is for months , i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath for , out of 52 minutes , so , basically what that means is i would purge , i &apos;d breath really hard for a minute .
i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress .
every morning , again , after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out .
but there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it , being on oprah .
so , i figured i &apos;m better off just fighting and staying there until i black out , at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that .
and then i realized that i had made it to 16 : 32 .
matt mills : now , what &apos;s great about this is , there &apos;s no trickery here .
tamara , would you like to jump in ?
okay . now we &apos;re going to switch back into the aurasma application , and what tamara &apos;s going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge , so that i can remember it forever .
due to our release , through factories and automobiles every year , of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide -- which helps air absorb heat from the sun -- our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer .
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
first , even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today , global warming would continue .
and then we watched , as one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year , westwardly .
today , there &apos;s another kind of movement . it &apos;s a movement to save the earth .
it &apos;s not ancient history .
then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution , which was we changed the environment in which we evolved .
but these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology .
other states have banned them .
same thing happened with the mouflon , where it &apos;s an endangered species of sheep .
it &apos;s not just insects .
finally , mussa-ivaldi of northwestern took a completely intact , independent lamprey eel brain .
does industry get to create creatures who , in their milk , in their blood , and in their saliva and other bodily fluids , create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines ?
and he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color .
the earliest members of our lineage , the genus homo , were darkly pigmented .
but all of the uvb , or nearly all of it , is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere .
these have tremendous consequences for our health .
you don &apos;t have to think about some exotic examples , or fossils .
there are many different kinds of mess .
it was 1.48 .
if you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little .
i was very much involved in it , but then turned my attention to other phenomena .
the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect .
to the right , on top , you see a theory which is very , very fashionable .
my uncle was a very prominent mathematician , and he told me , &quot; look , there &apos;s a problem which i could not solve 25 years ago , and which nobody can solve .
so where did this come from ?
and we were certainly in the driver &apos;s seat , making all these decisions , and let me tell you , if some of you had been there , it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience .
and you know that .
how do you know that ?
you were responsible for your decision .
and who gets to express it , and how do we express it ?
and that business is agriculture .
in africa , small farmers bear the brunt of this risk .
after having spent more than a decade understanding , studying , and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africa &apos;s agricultural markets , i decided it was time to do something about it .
in the design of our commodity exchange in ethiopia , we &apos;ve done something rather unique , which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective , or what we call the ecx edge .
but it will create new opportunities .
the threat is desertification .
and yet desertification is a major threat on all continents , affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world &apos;s agricultural drylands .
trees or cacti are good for this .
i &apos;m not an economist , very much not , but i did , quite literally , a back of the envelope calculation -- -- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars .
the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century .
i had no practical skills .
we &apos;ve seen lots of excitement from these people , who can now start a construction business , parts manufacturing , organic csa or just selling power back to the grid .
and he does that every day , and every day , probably , that guy in the picture walks on by , because he sees that little boy , but he doesn &apos;t see him .
we know , because in the mid-19th century , wonderful victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet , and disease dropped dramatically .
we ingest nutrients . we excrete nutrients as well .
they tried selling soap as healthy . no one bought it .
so this woman , this boy &apos;s mother installed this latrine in a few hours .
it &apos;s 2013 , yet 2.5 billion people in the world have no access to a basic sanitary toilet . and when there &apos;s no loo , where do you poo ? in the street , probably near your water and food sources -- causing untold death and disease from contamination . get ready for a blunt , funny , powerful talk from journalist rose george about a once-unmentionable problem .
and that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
it &apos;s not just the fish , though , that are disappearing .
now another form of pollution that &apos;s biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients .
it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france .
and you come home , and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in north america and in europe have dropped their leaves .
so the question is : will we respond to this or not ?
think about it .
i remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height .
maybe it was swamp gas , but -- -- i know what i saw .
there was a character called the third-stage guild navigator , which was a kind of giant , floating fetus-creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him , allowing him to bend space and time .
two : the alien was played by a rubber puppet .
the freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders , clustering into a kind of a tan .
two hours , they gave me a message .
trash the system or crash the planet -- it &apos;s a tough choice ; it isn &apos;t much of a choice .
now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies , but it plays an absolutely vital role .
this is a strange , rather perverse , story , just to put it in very simple terms .
these ones , interestingly , are 400 miles north of here outside barrow-in-furness in cumbria .
and in the same token , the solution becomes clear , because this isn &apos;t , therefore , about changing human nature .
it has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures .
and at the heart of that economics , we &apos;re placing a more credible , more robust , and more realistic vision of what it means to be human .
as the world faces recession , climate change , inequity and more , tim jackson delivers a piercing challenge to established economic principles , explaining how we might stop feeding the crises and start investing in our future .
and then when i took that moment to take a step back , magic .
sometimes , when sheila would lay down in the milk , it would wash all the paint off of her arms , and it might seem a little bit clumsy , but our solution would be , okay , hide your arms .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen -- that &apos;s methane -- it just floats off .
nobody gets up in the morning and thinks , &quot; wow ! i &apos;m going to go buy some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work . &quot;
we talk about energy independence . we talk about hydrogen cars .
so , you might be wondering why it is that , every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill , we call these ceos down to washington , and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .
and so what we did was , actually , we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling .
we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th .
one of the things that we also need to do , is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world , before you reduce the amount of oil that we use .
and what it says is , &quot; the national academy of sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates 29 cents in health care costs . &quot;
we are going to watch &quot; afghan star . &quot; we are late .
so just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in abu dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience .
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier .
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time .
after he swam the north pole , lewis pugh vowed never to take another cold-water dip . then he heard of lake imja in the himalayas , created by recent glacial melting , and lake pumori , a body of water at an altitude of 5300 m on everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change .
this one is a two-bit counter .
can we get self-replicating-type behavior ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape -- the b -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
you know , i &apos;ll do a julia childs here .
and i think this applies across a very broad -- sort of , a lot of concepts .
saul griffith : everyday inventions
but when we live in a denser community , suddenly what we find , of course , is that the things we need are close by .
it did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths , though .
this is one way to do it .
the red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man , as opposed to passing away of natural causes , in a variety of foraging societies in the new guinea highlands and the amazon rainforest .

steven pinker : the surprising decline in violence
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like .
when i talk to my students about global issues , and i listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about &quot; we &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
and partly to usa who help to provide technical advice and investment .
and united states only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time .
but this was 1963 .
and it goes over here ?
we cannot put it into two parts .
with income down there and child mortality .
5.5 percent . they are faster than the millennium development goal .
this is dollar per person . this is hiv in the countries .
make it a local issue . and do prevention at each place , in the way it can be done there .
but you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
by cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas .
so like in tennis , usually it &apos;s win-lose ; it always adds up to zero-zero-sum . but if you &apos;re playing doubles , the person on your side of the net , they &apos;re in the same boat as you , so you &apos;re playing a non-zero-sum game with them .
now , back to the unfolding apocalypse .
in my defense , i &apos;d say , as naive as this may sound , it &apos;s ultimately grounded in cynicism .
i think it &apos;s the first step toward that . that &apos;s the long-term goal .
the g8 summit proposes that the solution to africa &apos;s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something akin to the marshall plan .
but equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
well , since i &apos;m not seeing the hand , it appears that what i &apos;m stating is true .
well , because it gives them good , paying jobs , or , in many african countries , unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption .
because they don &apos;t need to talk to their own citizens .
you need wembley stadium to host our parliament .
&quot; not good . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s terrific . i &apos;m proud of it .
and starting about six years ago , we asked about extremely happy people .
the first life is the pleasant life and it &apos;s simply , as best we can find it , it &apos;s having as many of the pleasures as you can , as much positive emotion as you can , and learning the skills -- savoring , mindfulness -- that amplify them , that stretch them over time and space .
when the first card is played , until 10 days later , the tournament is over , time stops for len .
i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that lastingly change those lives ?
and this is really what you &apos;re about . and that &apos;s our target variable .
and it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of relieving misery .
shot straight down , so these are the shadows of the camels .
and he said , &quot; oh , yeah , i remember that too !
and a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .
and most of that growth is not in the cities , but in the slums that surround them .

and it has the ituri forest itself -- about 1,300 species of plants , so far known .
i even &#91; at &#93; that time was not speaking swahili .
and what of important things -- i think all of you here have a cell phone .
that is coltan extraction , gold mining .
one day , we went to meet the chief commander .
the elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks .
i don &apos;t think that someone may blame google , because it &apos;s doing the right things , even if people like al-qaeda are using google to connect between them .
corneille ewango : a hero of the congo forest
over the past three decades , we have lived through a quiet revolution .
and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a foundation . they will provide the funds .
hm : to be frank , i just think this is , not to offend anyone , a very american way .
one of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality , the sense that we are all in it together .
they &apos;re powerful enough to cut growth in half .
now what if we could achieve that historic two-percent growth for the next 70 years ?
and that 0.8 is the big challenge .
that &apos;s the percentage of american agricultural land it took to feed the horses .
so you get google , you get amazon , you get wikipedia , and you get running water and indoor toilets .
i do have to say , somebody -- i read recently that van gogh wasn &apos;t really necessarily psychotic , that he might have had temporal lobe seizures , and that might have caused his spurt of creativity , and i don &apos;t -- i suppose it does something in some part of your brain .
and so , i had this notion of death all around me , because my mother also believed that i would be next , and she would be next .
you won &apos;t discover anything .
there &apos;s an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do , and then we do something .
and it was the same thing that i felt when i was growing up , and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father , who was a baptist minister .
these are the things i constantly think about from day to day .
and i said yes , about this village of singing people , singing minority .
and i also can find that by imagining fully , and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world , the fictional world .
and it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether you &apos;re running a coffee shop or you &apos;re an intellectual , or you &apos;re in business , or you &apos;re flying hot air balloons .
and i ignored every message because i don &apos;t have a pain reliever problem .

not because it &apos;s hard to make interesting mustard -- you can make interesting mustard -- but people don &apos;t because no one &apos;s obsessed with it , and thus no one tells their friends .
my father has this on his desk , and he sees his grandchildren everyday , changing constantly .
they didn &apos;t triple their sales with advertising ; they tripled it by doing something remarkable .
now , as an artist , a woman , an arab , or a human being living in the world in 2010 , i only had one thing to say : i wanted to say no .
after acts of violence , another artist came , painted blood , protesters being run over by the tank , demonstrators , and a message that read , &quot; starting tomorrow , i wear the new face , the face of every martyr . i exist . &quot;
one : fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet .
pete alcorn : the world in 2200
this is a photo that i made showing one of these pups that &apos;s only about five or seven days old -- still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly -- that has fallen in because of the thin ice , and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase .
and this just drags over the bottom , in this case to catch shrimp .
i also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead , an animal that really hadn &apos;t been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .
and today , they crawl out and see condominiums .
and this was an animal that was struck by a ship in nova scotia , canada being towed in , where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death , which was indeed a ship strike .
every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy , from tiny , little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold .
having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together , just now like victims for every baby , six have disappeared from the forest .
it &apos;s no longer the poorest district , and there is a huge development of biodiversity .
this is how it looks like in practice . we have this grass we want to get rid of .
this is what it looked like for three months .
you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen , and without those microorganisms , you won &apos;t have any performance at all .
so we lowered air temperature three to five degrees celsius .

eight hundred two-liter soda bottles -- oh yea .
but i would say , &quot; if i did that , too much would be lost . &quot;
well thank you so much . that was a gorgeous treat for us .
speaking about the design : every city has its own design .
i &apos;ll speak on this later on .
we don &apos;t rip our family portrait , even if we don &apos;t like the nose of our uncle , because this portrait is you .
ok ?
it belongs to the soul , and the soul is not a part of the physical world .
some days it goes up and some days it doesn &apos;t go up . &quot;
well , the first feature is , it &apos;s real and irreducible .
sorry to use philosophical terminology here , but when it &apos;s secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons , a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up .
i add two plus two to get four .
and the message i want to leave you with is , consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon , as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology , or , for that matter , the rest of science .
i believe fundamentally , as many speakers have said during the past few days , that we make very poor use of our talents .
every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it &apos;s not enough .
and many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries .
&quot; it has multiple functions . &quot;
he said i was throwing my life away if that &apos;s all i chose to do with it ; that i should go to college , i should become a professional person , that i had great potential and i was wasting my talent to do that . &quot;
the other big issue is conformity .
we have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education , a manufacturing model , which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people .
thank you .
so here steve pinker and i were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries .
in half a century of trying to help prevent wars , there &apos;s one question that never leaves me : how do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return ?
and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence .
i have a little mantra .
totally ineffective .
and i think there are signs that it is beginning to change .
we &apos;re using the kind of skills that i &apos;ve outlined : inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge , recognizing and working with our fear , using anger as a fuel , cooperating with others , banding together with others , courage , and most importantly , commitment to active non-violence .
it is objectless . there are no things in it .
you can see i don &apos;t do much . i &apos;m just standing there , again with my eyes closed , and other people are molding me , evidential .
i think of it as a 21st-century buddha .
legendary sculptor antony gormley riffs on space and the human form . his works explore the interior space we feel within our own bodies -- and the exterior space we feel around us , knowing that we are just dots in space and time .
so the equation is conceptual .
the cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
you cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
if we can actually do it , it must be possible .
the continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
but as particular as they feel to us , we know we &apos;re not alone .
but the number of arts participants , people who write poetry , who sing songs , who perform in church choirs , is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations .
and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon .
the whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead .
and my building was a scale model for the pittsburgh airport .
those are real and they &apos;re in my building every day .
i would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen .
we train corporate travel agents for the travel industry .
these were children who the whole world had given up on , who were flunking out of public school , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked out pretty good up to this day .
he said , &quot; no , sir . you &apos;re the gift .
and this is our new facility , which is all video technology .
and this is what i want to do when i grow up .
and willie brown said , &quot; as sure as i &apos;m the mayor of san francisco , i &apos;m going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city . &quot;
and i think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in pittsburgh .
and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope .
so , you know , it &apos;s sort of a complicated thing . you have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you &apos;re seeing .
how important is this ?
so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna .
and so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals .
on bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in , since it &apos;s just in those couple feet of water .
it &apos;s not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you &apos;re enormous , that would have no effect on you . you &apos;re huge .
they all have a species-specific system -- they have a molecule that says &quot; me . &quot;
and so that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve sort of taken two strategies .
we think , by studying bacteria , we &apos;re going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body .
bonnie bassler discovered that bacteria &quot; talk &quot; to each other , using a chemical language that lets them coordinate defense and mount attacks . the find has stunning implications for medicine , industry -- and our understanding of ourselves .
who else ?
one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy , but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians .
it would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart .
charley : i &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
here &apos;s how he put it .
the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging .
right . we did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in long beach , and we do it in a classroom at harvard with about 1,000 students .
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .
and you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this .
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon .
and you see it in all sorts of technologies .
we do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
and this turns out to be useful .
what can damage accumulate in ?
and i think we know how to do it . and i &apos;ll stop there .
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?
raised quite a few eyebrows in iceland .
the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table .
so i &apos;ve had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who i am and where i am today .
since then , we &apos;ve doubled the number of roads in america , and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation .
and millennials , certainly , these engines of entrepreneurship , 64 percent of whom decide first where they want to live , then they move there , then they look for a job , they will come to your city .
briefly mentioning , we have an asthma epidemic in this country .
&quot; cities are pestilential to the health , to the liberties , to the morals of man .
yet all of these innovations -- that &apos;s what they said in the brochure .
how do we solve the problem of the suburbs ? urbanist jeff speck shows how we can free ourselves from dependence on the car -- which he calls &quot; a gas-belching , time-wasting , life-threatening prosthetic device &quot; -- by making our cities more walkable and more pleasant for more people .
he was the last person who had this frog , a colony of these things , in his lab .
the second project i want to talk to you about is the thylacine project .
all we know is , soon after the dingoes were brought in , thylacines were extinct in the australian mainland , and after that they only survived in tasmania .
every old curator who &apos;d been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen , put their hand in the jar , pulled it out and thought , &quot; wow , look at that , &quot; plop , dropped it back in the jar , contaminating this specimen .
and it just , when i spoke to this man , i was looking in his eyes and thinking , behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like , what they smelled like , what they sounded like .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is why we &apos;re trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects .
i want to remind you again -- i know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion .
we were going nowhere .
it is all the resources that were taken from africa , including human , that built these countries today !
she was three years old and i was 15 .
i was so happy -- -- that my sister was alive !
what did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid ?
have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about -- have they ever called these people together and said , &quot; look , your foundation and your foundation -- you have so much money , we are grateful .
that agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market .
why can &apos;t some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms , to enable people to take risk ?
so i am a surgeon who studies creativity , and i have never had a patient tell me that &quot; i really want you to be creative during surgery , &quot; and so i guess there &apos;s a little bit of irony to it .
maybe we &apos;re not the right people to do it .
and it works like this -- this doesn &apos;t actually produce any sound .
and so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity .
and it &apos;s good that it &apos;s not too quick .
and so this is what you do : you have a free-style artist come in and memorize a rap that you write for them , that they &apos;ve never heard before , and then you have them free-style .
you have heightened brain activity when you &apos;re doing a comparable task , when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .
i mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling .
the second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
tan le : okay , so let &apos;s choose &quot; pull . &quot;
thank you , evan , you &apos;re a wonderful , wonderful example of the technology .
bill gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work , so thank you .
malaria is one of the great public health problems .
today , you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure , create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it .
you can give drug administration .
the united states did .
moore &apos;s law made computing cheap ; so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down .
this is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s then distributed , and distribution is a massive issue .
and i was thinking , well i &apos;m trying to think nature , nature , nature .
all of the soil you can see there is basically my food , which is generated by the restaurant , and it &apos;s growing in these tubs , which i made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things .
and this is an english willow air diffuser , and that &apos;s softly moving that air current through the room .
in fact , i &apos;m trying and i &apos;m going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world .
basically i &apos;m recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chronologically compiling these one-second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
eventually , these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches .
in fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
so as soon it has been to the sea , it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here , and it knows always where it is on the beach . so it &apos;s very simple brain .
we decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route , even though nobody had been there before , to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life .
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .
and we found that 10 out of the 11 100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence .
so we won &apos;t give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
also , at synthetic genomics , we &apos;ve been working on major environmental issues .
i &apos;d set aside three weeks for this project , and that , i think , is what is meant by &quot; hubris &quot; -- -- because it turned out to be three months .
&quot; some of these verses are definite in meaning , &quot; it says , &quot; and others are ambiguous . &quot;
and in particular , how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization .
so every year , on the same day -- and it &apos;s a mystery exactly how that happens -- each colony sends out its virgin , unmated queens with wings , and the males , and they all fly to a common place . and they mate .
and it &apos;s when they reach this stable size , in numbers of ants , that they start to reproduce .
so that &apos;s what the midden workers do .
and then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce .
so for example , if i make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up , then i see fewer ants out foraging .
instead , something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .
in the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope .
thank you .
now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth , you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid-east and away from us .
over that period you are going to double your demand .
it &apos;s ours , we have an abundance of it .
but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas , because you have plenty of natural gas .
the first one was barnett shale in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across new york , pennsylvania , west virginia ; and haynesville in louisiana .
and he said , &quot; well it &apos;s a bridge fuel , is what it is . &quot;
there isn &apos;t anything wrong with nuke .
tbp : solar and wind , jim and i agreed on that in 13 seconds .
t. boone pickens : let &apos;s transform energy -- with natural gas
people on the east coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news , they thought , &quot; ah , this isn &apos;t real . &quot;
this is actually from the klondike gold rush . this is the white pass trail .
and that was , of course , the very common story .
so all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- i &apos;m going back now to , sort of , the explosive part of the web in 1994 , when it was growing 2,300 percent a year .
i want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
and they couldn &apos;t yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house .
because , you know , resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the gold rush , then you &apos;d be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone .
and i think it &apos;s great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths .
it &apos;s not consciously self-serving , but to a biologist , that &apos;s the logic .
basically it &apos;s just like , if you &apos;re my enemy , if you &apos;re my rival -- if you &apos;re not my friend , if you &apos;re not in my family -- i &apos;m much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you .
either way , your fortunes add up to zero . that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
you saw it with the recent economic crash , where bad things happen in the economy -- bad for everybody , for much of the world .
if there &apos;s one thing i can encourage everyone to do , politicians , religious leaders , and us , it would be what i call &quot; expanding the moral imagination &quot; -- that is to say , your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .
in oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named alice stewart .
it flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the x-ray machine .
i wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
and it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
well , the university of delft requires that its phd students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
so , this guy , with all the cells in his body , all have the same genetic information .
so , he made a filtrate , he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter , and he injected it to another chicken , and he got another tumor .
so you take them out , you put them in a dish , they don &apos;t make milk . they completely forget .
so we said , what is on the surface of these ugly tumors ?
and maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed .
i have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post-docs who have taught me so much , and i have had many of these groups come and go .
no , that looked good , it was about two thirds of you .
you just didn &apos;t want to respond to that person that time .
but actually , what i &apos;ve been finding is very different from that .
and they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came , or the woman that didn &apos;t look at all like her photo .
most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes . the eyes are the window to the soul .
you remember those astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before ? well , when they write a fake review , they have to post it somewhere , and it &apos;s left behind for us .
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
okay glass , hang out with the flying club .
you saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there .
i would just light up a cigarette . it would look cooler .
it does not come for me from research .
so i do it .
because it &apos;s mortifying , and yet it feels ...
i went to parsons school of design and then i began my career as a designer .
her grandmother says , &quot; delish ! &quot;
im : it looks good , yeah ?
it &apos;s , like , this website .
chef : for cream ?
in medieval societies there were defined allegiances .
at the age of 22 , i was co-founding this organization in denmark .
now that never would have been possible before .
one of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently .
and what happens as a result of this is , when those parties are elected , and inevitably they fail , or inevitably they make political mistakes , democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes .
without human rights , you don &apos;t have the protection granted to you to campaign .
and it &apos;s with that thought that i &apos;ll end .
the first one is the famous one , the printing press : movable type , oil-based inks , that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned europe upside-down , starting in the middle of the 1400s .
every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well , because the same equipment -- phones , computers -- let you consume and produce .
people collating information , pointing people to news sources , pointing people to the us geological survey .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by amateurs .
it is the green lines now , that are the source of the free content , which brings me to my last story .
media , the media landscape that we knew , as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs , is increasingly slipping away .
it &apos;s actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars .
these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up .
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i &apos;ll tell you about .
ok , this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself .
our two strongest climbers , todd burleson and pete athans , decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going .
apparently , doug had died higher up on the mountain .
he really said that .
so you have the prefrontal cortex here , lighting up in red .
and , you can see , there &apos;s an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain , where he &apos;s got images of his family , into this area , which is powering his will .
this was scott fischer , rob hall , andy harris , doug hansen and yasuko namba .
the first is really the notion of people .
english language was seen as a language of the imperialists .
i believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital , the rise of indian entrepreneurs , the rise of english as a language of aspiration , technology as something empowering , globalization as a positive factor , and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why india is today growing at rates it has never seen before .
for a long time we have neglected our cities .
this needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce , you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised .
just to give an idea , the world has to stabilize at something like 20 gigatons per year .
thank you very much .
basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for .
and you have more choice-driven societies .
and basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
we are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust .
five great revolutions have shaped political culture over the past 50 years , says theorist ivan krastev . he shows how each step forward -- from the cultural revolution of the &apos; 60s to recent revelations in the field of neuroscience -- has also helped erode trust in the tools of democracy . as he says , &quot; what went right is also what went wrong . &quot; can democracy survive ?
do you want to also help government find whether there &apos;s a better economic model , not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again , but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims ?
and even more worryingly , and this is a home office statistic , 70 percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care .
and again , in peterborough , we started off with a program , but we also collected data , and over the period of time , we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements , so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term : greater engagement from the prisoners , longer-term engagement as well .
i said , &quot; where are the qataris ? &quot;
some people don &apos;t want to talk about them . i &apos;m here to talk about them tonight .
there &apos;s so much , we laugh , right ?
just as you &apos;re walking down : &quot; &#91; imitating arabic &#93; -- strawberry ! &quot;
so i do a lot of my work outside brisbane and outside australia , and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world .
in a highly entertaining performance , beatboxer tom thum slings beats , comedy and a mouthful of instrumental impersonations into 11 minutes of creativity and fun that will make you smile .
we got our first panel out on december third .
and if you don &apos;t know how , please find me -- i will help you .
we can do it without harming any tissue .
and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain .
and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively .
he returned to a normal life routine .
so again , this is an immediate relief .
and this will take time .
she &apos;s an italian fashion designer .
and then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because joe blow owns it .
and they &apos;ve been faced with a lot of lawsuits , but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers .
and this , let me tell you , is very good for the bottom line .
they knock themselves off .
there &apos;s a bunch of other industries that don &apos;t have copyright protection , including the food industry .
it is more complex than this , but this will do .
johanna blakley : lessons from fashion &apos;s free culture
one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord , only to find that the archeologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found .
now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .
and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you &apos;ll remember it &apos;s actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches .
these also tend to grow clonally , the oldest of which is 13,000 years old .
they &apos;ve survived for millennia in desert , in the permafrost , at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean .
let &apos;s go to this google map , and i &apos;ll show you how you can edit it .
in the hands of the ted community , these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world , but in the hands of suicide bombers , the future can look quite different .
and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan , where they monitored the bbc , al jazeera , cnn and indian local stations .
during this 60-hour siege on mumbai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill .
little robots are cute when they play music to you .
if you control the code , you control the world .
the technologies got better , and now dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore &apos;s law .
the cost of doing a dna sequence is going to be trivial .
thank you .
&quot; better immersion than to live untouched . &quot;
and i thought , after all this atrocity , this is how human beings really pray .
he said , &quot; we used to feel like nobodies , but now we feel like somebodies . &quot;
born and raised in baltimore , he studied real estate , worked in commercial real estate , and after 9 / 11 decided he was going to pakistan to make a difference .
and every day he would watch her , and it looked like she was talking to the people .
they won &apos;t necessarily be easy lives , but in the end , it is all that will sustain us .
which ones of these could be self-portraits ?
they are made in the right order .
then , being her husband , i ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth .
&quot; close your eyes . whatever i give , it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring , even a chocolate , i will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it .
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls .
am : and previously , you need a multimillion investment for machine and all . now , any rural woman can .
when he realized his wife had to choose between buying family meals and buying her monthly &quot; supplies , &quot; arunachalam muruganantham vowed to help her solve the problem of the sanitary pad . his research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model .
i have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much .
i had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
and i thought , in two days &apos; time , i was going to do this swim across the north pole .
this is such an important swim .
lewis pugh : ten seconds to swim . ten seconds to swim .
four or five children sitting behind a desk , and even in those poorest conditions , they all have a very , very good grasp of climate change .
come talk to me about it , i &apos;ll fill in some of the details if you want .
well , we have to take a little excursion , and we &apos;ll start in central texas .
how the molecules are put together .
now , i had two preconditions .
i wanted to be , as i later thought of it , empathic , which is to say , to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation .
these were people through their 90s .
it &apos;s pre-programmed . it &apos;s infomercial , and we all have infomercials about our lives .
and i began to wonder what was going on , and you think while you talk , and basically , i thought , i got it .
now , there are other ways that you get somebody to open up , and this is just a brief reference .
and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had , because he saw the letters .
she came on . of course she was wheelchaired on .
so why is it that this year &apos;s new cars look pretty much exactly like last year &apos;s new cars ?
it won lots of awards .
what &apos;s a problem you want to solve ? &quot;
it &apos;s not uncommon for mom to put a blanket over the baby .
so our goal is to study how they work , the resources they have access to , so that they can make this product .
are we designing for the world that we have ?
and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits : it had no clients , nobody would buy the electricity there , nobody was interested in irrigation projects .
many of them didn &apos;t want to bribe .
in london , for instance , where the bae got away with a huge corruption case , which the serious fraud office tried to prosecute , 100 million british pounds , every year for ten years , to one particular official of one particular friendly country , who then bought for 44 billion pounds of military equipment .
some of the world &apos;s most baffling social problems , says peter eigen , can be traced to systematic , pervasive government corruption , hand-in-glove with global companies . in his talk , eigen describes the thrilling counter-attack led by his organization transparency international . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i choose a painting . it might just be one painting in 50 .
so here &apos;s how i came up with the story .
this is very plain ; the only thing that isn &apos;t plain is her pearl earring .
and he didn &apos;t look at me . he was still looking at his cards , and that &apos;s one of the seductive elements of this painting is , he &apos;s so focused on what he &apos;s doing that he doesn &apos;t look at us .
what is he thinking about that &apos;s making him blush ?
he managed to make the word tender .
when tracy chevalier looks at paintings , she imagines the stories behind them : how did the painter meet his model ? what would explain that look in her eye ? why is that man … blushing ? she shares three stories inspired by portraits , including the one that led to her best-selling novel &quot; girl with a pearl earring . &quot;
so when we came back to italy , and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories .
action .
suspense , fun and intrigue .
just me and god-given talent .
i spent , you know , several weeks with all these actors , producers , and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for , you know , a westerner , a filmmaker who works in america or in europe .
no stories around the campfire .
fs : oh , yes . i think i mentioned briefly -- it &apos;s close to 2,000 films .
fs : you can be in a lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water . yes .
&quot; sorry , moma , video games are not art . &quot;
we were talking about dancing ponies , but i was really jealous of the walker arts center for putting up this festival , because it &apos;s very , very wonderful .
so when i show the sims , i try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with the sims , not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the tamagotchi .
but we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design , so maybe one day we &apos;ll be able to acquire also the guns .
time . the way we experience time in video games , as in other forms of interaction design , is really quite amazing .
it was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain .
and then , once i deal with the context , i then try to make a place that &apos;s comfortable and private and fairly serene , as i hope you &apos;ll find that slide on the right .
and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the walker .
this was built in six months .
and most of the imagery is -- claes &apos; , but those two little boys are my sons , and they were claes &apos; assistants in the play .
but we were trying to collide our ideas , to put objects next to each other .
it &apos;s a way of connecting , at least , with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture .
and so i decided to put him in a depression .
it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
it &apos;s hard to do high-rise .
that &apos;s the living room .
these are the early studies , but they have to sell furniture to normal people , so if i did the building and it was too fancy , then people might say , &quot; well , the furniture looks ok in his thing , but no , it ain &apos;t going to look good in my normal building . &quot;
on the side facing the street it &apos;s much more normal , except i slipped a few mansards down , so that coming on the point , these housing units made a gesture to the corner .
the light grid will have a light , be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling .
but finally , there &apos;s a hotel there .
the original building , because it was frog-like , fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well .
and the food wasn &apos;t as good as the stuff , and so it failed .
fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy doesn &apos;t cook the way that they like their food prepared .
so over the next couple of years , students and i worked to develop a process .
but one of the things that we found it didn &apos;t burn as long . and the briquettes crumbled a little bit , and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking .
so not only do you have health benefits , you have environmental benefits .
and we need to rethink our development strategies , so that we &apos;re not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers .
it &apos;s where our senses are located , our special senses -- our vision , our speech , our hearing , our smell , our taste .
here &apos;s a classic example : rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that &apos;s growing out through her skull , has obliterated her nose , and she &apos;s having difficulty seeing .
turn to the person next to you , push your lower jaws forward . turn to the person next to you and look at them -- they look miserable .
he enjoyed life to the full , and this was probably because he had a successful , fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially .
and actually that &apos;s probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery .
now we know that he &apos;s a convicted wife-batterer , and actually he &apos;s not the good guy .
this is the bar that he set for us .
so there are going to be problems with face transplantation .
how do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal husbandry .
what goes in is what we are .
it &apos;s because of the way the government commodifies food , and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really , really cheap .
we really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe .
they also may be growing them . and we serve them in the cafeterias .
i work with private companies who are willing to do r &amp; amp ; d with me , who are willing to do distribution for me , who are really willing to work to go into schools .
but we really have to educate .
now i don &apos;t know about you , but i go to starbucks and pete &apos;s and places like that , and venti latte in san francisco is five dollars .
that &apos;s part of you up there .
and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think , &quot; that &apos;s impossible ! you can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot;
now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
so this is the problem . so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a magic trick explained to you .
we &apos;re looking for a backer .
and i noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge .
how many of you rotated the one on the right ? ok .
as a cube , on a black background , as seen through a piece of swiss cheese .
so now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
what i wanted to show you is that scientists , using their from-the-outside , third-person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .
they &apos;re essentially , to a point , attempts at planning what other people should do , planning their life for them .
now , that &apos;s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
but what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect , that people hated it more and more .
it &apos;s an unfortunate reality in nearly every major city — road congestion , especially during rush hours . jonas eliasson reveals how subtly nudging just a small percentage of drivers to stay off major roads can make traffic jams a thing of the past .
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
so when you hear what i &apos;m going to talk about here today , first of all , i want to say that i am here on behalf of all the patients that i have ever met , all the ones i haven &apos;t met .
and when the web came along , that changed everything , because not only could we find information , we could find other people like ourselves who could gather , who could bring us information .
so i went in for an ultrasound .
well , so what i read on webmd : &quot; the prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer .
because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help , think about this .
you see , that &apos;s the immune system .
and it goes like this .
so she took it .
when dave debronkart learned he had a rare and terminal cancer , he turned to a group of fellow patients online -- and found the medical treatment that saved his life . now he calls on all patients to talk with one another , know their own health data , and make health care better one e-patient at a time . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so i &apos;d like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn &apos;t existed before ; imagine a mining industry that doesn &apos;t mean defiling the earth ; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine .
now , what i mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose . this sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment , and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image .
the chinese word for &quot; bat &quot; sounds like the chinese word for &quot; happiness , &quot; and they believe that bats bring wealth , health , longevity , virtue and serenity .
and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases , or does this variation just make you different ?
as we age , we deteriorate , and this deterioration causes problems for our society , so we have to address it .
in western society , bats are often characterized as creepy , even evil . zoologist emma teeling encourages us to rethink our attitude toward bats , whose unique and fascinating biology gives us insight into our own genetic makeup . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , what did you do , last time you got serious ?
the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
so , what goes wrong ? why is there this &quot; resource curse , &quot; as it &apos;s called ?
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , &quot; why not try an auction ? it &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
around the world right now , one billion people are trapped in poor or failing countries . how can we help them ? economist paul collier lays out a bold , compassionate plan for closing the gap between rich and poor .
surgeons are not made either .
this is allan okrainec from toronto .
this past year i &apos;ve been in latin america , i &apos;ve been in china , talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place .
steven schwaitzberg : a universal translator for surgeons
i liked the fine detail it gave my work , but i wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
i &apos;ll leave you with this story .
so whenever i fill up my gas , i think of that liter , and how much carbon .
but now , we have a real technology to do this .
as they do it , in the upper left is a display that &apos;s yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience , psychology , etc .
the concept of physical health is undefined .
now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
but the demagogues are right about one thing : we need a universal conception of human values .
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face -- i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
questions of good and evil , right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science . but sam harris argues that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues , shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life .
you see the mother in between and two daughters , probably on the left and right , and a single egg on the right-hand side .
and after a few days , depending upon temperature , the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside .
but again , the question is , here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest , the natural enemy .
why good bugs ?
so i think my last slide is : all we are saying , we can actually sing it : give nature a chance .
i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter , so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject .
the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . i do a lot of that .
urban absurdism -- that &apos;s what the new yorker really calls for .
her former name was fay wray , and so that was -- i didn &apos;t have the wit to say , &quot; take the painting . &quot;
in the case of norse greenland , the hostiles were the inuit -- the eskimos sharing greenland -- with whom the norse got off to bad relationships . and we know that the inuit killed the norse and , probably of greater importance , may have blocked access to the outer fjords , on which the norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year .
for example , among the greenland norse -- a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs . and that led the chiefs to do what &apos;s called flogging the land : overstocking the land , forcing tenant farmers into dependency . and that made the chiefs powerful in the short run , but led to the society &apos;s collapse in the long run .
and here you see just a selection .
there &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
in a lot of food items that we have -- i have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or , if you like , campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye .
so if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average , and a third of the world population is living in china and in india , we &apos;re having an enormous demand on meat .
so that &apos;s two points for insects .
and then 80 percent of the world already eats insects , so we are just a minority -- in a country like the u.k. , the usa , the netherlands , anywhere .
and maybe by 2020 , you &apos;ll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you &apos;re going to eat .
ah : oh my god , it &apos;s harsh up here .
i &apos;d already waited 10 months , and i had to wait 18 more months .
no reference checks . none of the usual background stuff , no .
as technology progresses , and as it advances , many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent , make us smarter and more connected to the world .
the idea is actually relatively simple .
and this one , this is a replica from a 15th-century device .
but there is a difference between the two , because with your ipod you can tell -- or your iphone , you can tell exactly what the time is , with precision .
and advancing retes became cultural emblems .
it &apos;s a robot that has three legs , which is inspired by nature .
the first version , in the back , that &apos;s strider i .
it affects the diameter and then can turn to the left , turn to the right .
now , we don &apos;t have enough time to go into technical details , i &apos;ll just show you some of the experiments .
and this student , probably the first time using it , but she can articulate it many different ways .
i don &apos;t know how many of you have heard about robocup .
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
also , it &apos;s not about that , only about that . you also have to work really , really hard .
it &apos;s downtowns becoming ghost towns .
there &apos;s basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor &apos;s degree or higher .
but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there , there is a huge need .
and in match me , you take the class , divide it into two teams , one team on each side of the playground , and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires .
and what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring , rigid , verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by .
so for him , studio h offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect , everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client .
now there &apos;s no question about it at all : we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology .
now we know that desertification is caused by livestock , mostly cattle , sheep and goats , overgrazing the plants , leaving the soil bare and giving off methane .
we have never understood it .
there is only one option , i &apos;ll repeat to you , only one option left to climatologists and scientists , and that is to do the unthinkable , and to use livestock , bunched and moving , as a proxy for former herds and predators , and mimic nature .
this site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got .
i &apos;m just going to ask you one quick question .
so that &apos;s the personal reason .
... help us find children who can participate in project prakash . ) ps : so , as i zoom in to the eyes of this child , you will see the cause of his blindness .
what might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ?
patient : i can &apos;t make it out .
in fact , pam , if you &apos;re watching this , please forgive me .
looking ahead , if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we &apos;ve treated so far , this is the magnitude of the problem .
that &apos;s all i &apos;d ever known .
so , i met the man , walked in his office , and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached .
and if it came off at 85 there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going 200 meters .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
so they call us out and , you know -- &quot; ladies , you have one minute . &quot;
there are hair follicles on them , and i can paint my toenails .
and so , i run on these , and have shocked half the world on these .
there &apos;re veins on the feet , and then my heel is pink , and my achilles &apos; tendon -- that moves a little bit .
the recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe has been very emotional .
and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft , have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries .
yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history .
what do we mean when we say we &apos;re doing math , or educating people to do math ?
see , i think of calculating , in a sense , as the machinery of math .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s warranted .
if you were born after computers and paper , it doesn &apos;t really matter which order you &apos;re taught with them in , you just want to have the best tool .
i don &apos;t think so -- quite the opposite .
well , it &apos;s damn hard doing the calculations , that &apos;s the problem .
and the country that does this first will , in my view , leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even , an improved economy , an improved outlook .
now i was getting a little anxious .
my training had started .
and i &apos;m not paranoid , but everywhere i go , i &apos;m getting all sorts of advice : go here , move there , watch out for this .
often it &apos;s thought that that &apos;s an emotion that comes up out of pity .
chris downey : design with the blind in mind
although , listening to kevin kelly , you don &apos;t have to remember anything .
but i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible .
the bible actually talks about cognitive psychology , very primitive cognitive psychology .
the first is , thou shalt not take the bible literally .
third , that thou shall have reverence .
they &apos;re very inspiring leaders , even though i disagree with much of what they say .
so if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .
so we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
the academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous , so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser .
but it was that work that was seen by alex mcdowell , one of the world &apos;s legendary production designers .
and now , if we want to select stuff , 3d , space , the idea that we &apos;re tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in , not in 2d , not in fake 2d , but in actual 3d .
paul is the designer of this wand , and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what &apos;s going on .
we can &apos;t have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start .
so , whether it &apos;s logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that &apos;s not a killer app .
it &apos;s been deployed in washington d.c. to track snow cleanup .
lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions .
meanwhile , the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late .
so the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you &apos;re relying on the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers -- and when you &apos;re relying on the social part of the bargain , when you &apos;re really designing for generosity .
but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value .
the only difference between the mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
and so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in .
and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
there is cricket and the movies .
because we had this auction , you see .
now , this last minute before i go -- there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
now , this simple equation , even for those of you who don &apos;t like equations , is something that you &apos;re quite used to .
so , this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray . it &apos;s not just puzzles , though .
nine of them have been sold to these individuals .
and this is a systematic error people make .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
let me just give you an example .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . people don &apos;t think that way .
for example , when you &apos;re offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month .
at a very close distance , the fiddler looks taller than the fireman , but at a far distance their normal , their true , relations are preserved .
we have time for some questions for dan gilbert . one and two .
i mean , what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it ?
dg : well , you know , the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves .
aubrey de grey : my name &apos;s aubrey de grey , from cambridge .
once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject , i did the following series of drawings .
and i really struggled with this one .
and one day i woke up and i said , &quot; well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
one is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that i am confident about what i &apos;m doing .
but then again , it &apos;s on my list of didactic posters .
this reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response , no longer just about whether or not we &apos;re about to be poisoned , but whenever there &apos;s a threat of physical contamination from some source . but the face remains strikingly similar .
and he was really gagging . i thought he might throw up on me , actually .
the first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs , we found a general pattern -- this is with the psychologists yoel inbar and paul bloom -- that in fact , across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative .
in another one , we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her .
have you ever been ?
marcus : so what solutions do you offer ? i mean , the job of a poet is not just -- boy : man , fight the power ! simple : blow the motherfuckers out of the sky .
did you ever move your fuckin &apos; ass from hollywood to go and film something real ?
onicha : yes , mama .
ezra : i don &apos;t remember .
that is what you are here for , no ?
but we pay for school .
eo : well , we thank you again for coming to the ted stage .
mm : it starts playing immediately .
so melcher media &apos;s team , who &apos;s on the east coast -- and we &apos;re on the west coast , building the software -- takes our tool and , every day , drags in images and text .
you kept moving ahead in a life where you &apos;re dependent on working for somebody .
luckily i started to get some clients that had a little more money , so the stuff was a little more permanent .
he gets up there and then he ... comes back up .
i visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work , and his early work had a resemblance to my early work .
it &apos;s not his money , of course .
if it leaks -- bilbao did not leak .
what do you bring to it ?
just before going to lunch with the mayor , we went to the harbor commissioner .
fg : no , no . wait a minute !
i got out of the car , and i stood up , and it was a coal-mining town . i did a 360 turnaround , and that became one of the most surreal landscapes i &apos;ve ever seen .
it &apos;s even in my own conscience i &apos;m having it , and here in my work , i &apos;m trying to build that same toggle .
i &apos;m going to move to some pictures of china .
and this is what they were building .
the next round comes in . it &apos;s an incredible workforce that &apos;s building there . shanghai -- i &apos;m looking at the urban renewal in shanghai , and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years .
and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that when i saw these kinds of buildings , i was shocked to see that they &apos;re not using a central air-conditioning system ; every window has an air conditioner in it .
it took me five fake tries because they were just going . to slow them down was literally impossible .
while setting up this shot , people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch .
and to me the whole notion -- the things i &apos;m photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress .
and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic .
and i think there &apos;s a real possibility to reach new audiences if i had a chance .
and it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
this is the last frontier of recycling .
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
thank you for your time .
and having thought about this a little bit , i see a couple different possibilities .
the good news about holly though is that she doesn &apos;t actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .
it doesn &apos;t look like much -- in fact , it isn &apos;t like much .
you might have them start paying attention to price , paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token , as it were .
so much so that , if you saw the monkeys &apos; numbers , you couldn &apos;t tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market .
i &apos;m just going to give you 500 bucks .
well , it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level .
all the time , he adds one , to give the monkeys two .
the remarkable thing to us is that , when you give monkeys this choice , they do the same irrational thing that people do .
you know , think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things , fatty things like cheesecake .
laurie santos : a monkey economy as irrational as ours
now , one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum .
mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks .
and the way i describe it is this .
we were running windows 2000 .
sure , we invest plenty in innovation . we invest in broadband and science education and science grants , but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have .
now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .
what it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information .
thank you .
now , it was not always wonderful at that table .
a harvested field of grain , with some grain in the corners , reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest , but you must always leave some on the edges , just in case there &apos;s someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture .
twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message .
i think maybe it &apos;s one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all god &apos;s children would have their needs cared for , so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks , &quot; in regards to health , are all the children in ? &quot; and we could say yes .
but we &apos;re less attuned to the nuances of the public .
and while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time , there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness .
it can &apos;t go in the mall .
that was the lounge .
so we strained it from the edges , and we held it by cables .
could be used for anything , for performances , films , for installations .
well i was born in the most difficult time , when my country was at war .
so i &apos;m just going to go into a different step now , which is easier for me .
but i &apos;ve never seen a dead body , at least one that i &apos;ve killed .
i ate snails , vultures , rabbits , snakes , and anything that had life .
i don &apos;t eat breakfast . no lunch .
they only get the food that drops from the sky , from the u.n .
one of them happened to be me now .
i think that &apos;s possible , because there is a corner of the death penalty debate -- maybe the most important corner -- where everybody agrees , where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page .
so we have this paradox , which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down .
that &apos;s the second lesson that i &apos;ve learned .
but the fact that we still have a lot to learn , that doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t know a lot already .
what we &apos;re doing in the death penalty system is we &apos;re paying later .
and my father smiled and said , &quot; well , you know what that means , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
it was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents .
so , i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster .
now , apparently in jerusalem in 600 bc , everyone was completely bad and evil . every single one of them : man , woman , child , infant , fetus .
maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
martin luther king did not say , &quot; i have a nightmare , &quot; when he inspired the civil rights movements .
and we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations .
and really , this is what i &apos;ve done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environmental limits .
they are the u.s.a. , other western countries going across in those triangles and a few gulf states in there actually .
and they invested in social programs -- health and education .
and the point is , we need to carry on increasing well-being .
at a personal level , we need these nudges too .
keep learning .
and i &apos;d like to do a little collateral thinking , if you will , about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal .
then i started to think about the people in the himalayas whose cataracts would be helped , and i realized that i went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy , to feeling good for the people that were being helped . i think that &apos;s a motivator .
they &apos;re controlled by different parts of the brain .
there &apos;s a saying in the world of information science : ultimately everybody will know everything .
as a dancer , i know the nine rasas or the navarasas : anger , valor , disgust , humor and fear .
but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have .
it &apos;s the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you , so moves you , that something even like cancer becomes insignificant .
and these were all incompatible .
thanks .
the technology is linked data , and it &apos;s extremely simple .
well , in those documents , there are little squares , little boxes .
you hug your database , you don &apos;t want to let it go until you &apos;ve made a beautiful website for it .
well , you take that mouthful and you put it into google .
i did that to the map . i just did that !
y2k , the dotcom bubble , stressing about whose party you &apos;re going to go to as the clock strikes midnight , before the champagne goes flat , and then there &apos;s that inchoate yearning that was felt , i think , by many , that the millennium , that the year 2000 , should mean more , more than just a two and some zeroes .
there &apos;s hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake , tens of millions of lives , or deaths , at stake , and , i &apos;d argue , the security and future of you and your family is also at stake .
they need our help . they need the cavalry , and the cavalry &apos;s not going to come from mars .
the mexican g20 need not have been a bust .
and i didn &apos;t have the patience to wait until i reached home .
it &apos;s almost like a 3d photograph .
he would say , &quot; for the greater good . &quot;
this shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see ?
and they did .
it &apos;s called &quot; emerging angel . &quot;
then , again , that becomes an object .
alwar balasubramaniam &apos;s sculpture plays with time , shape , shadow , perspective : four tricky sensations that can reveal -- or conceal -- what &apos;s really out there . at tedindia , the artist shows slides of his extraordinary installations .
not quite ten percent .
a second reason has to do with peer pressure .
which brings me to my second point .
in the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside durban .
so , hopefully this will bring back some happy , or possibly some slightly disturbing memories .
yet , at google , we know it &apos;s the number-one searched for category .
but where we are today , things have changed .
the hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings , like the bow of a violin , to produce music .
i &apos;d like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education , by comparison .
so when do you play baseball ?
you talk about what you like .
there &apos;s always a winner in baseball , and that means there &apos;s always a loser in baseball .
what i and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional mri brain scanner .
as one polynesian said , he said , &quot; i felt like jumping in the sky . &quot;
i would say , &quot; would you die for him or her ? &quot;
it keeps bothering you a little bit , like being hungry .
then , women &apos;s worst invention was the plow .
almost always , when i &apos;m on tv , the producers who call me , who negotiate what we &apos;re going to say , is a woman .
in the western world , women start sooner at sex , have more partners , express less remorse for the partners that they do , marry later , have fewer children , leave bad marriages in order to get good ones .
with orgasm you get a spike of dopamine .
but more and more people in the united states are taking them long term .
mystery is important . you fall in love with somebody who &apos;s somewhat mysterious , in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain , probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love .
i &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .
she got diabetes . case closed .
you treat the obesity .
what if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening , an underlying epidemic , the one we ought to be worried about ?
some think it &apos;s too many calories consumed .
maybe the system , of which i was a part , was letting you down .
my great grandfather was henry ford , and on my mother &apos;s side , my great grandfather was harvey firestone .
and in time , my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today .
when you factor in population growth , it &apos;s clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow .
so parking garages , buses , trains , they all operate within the same system .
and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge -- and it &apos;s really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power , how much money and how much serious thought has , really over the last three years , just poured into the green energy field .
and how do you bring those two things together ?
and so , that was a really catalytic thing for them .
and he invented the shipping container .
we wrote a book recently , i think you might have received it , called &quot; thoughtless acts ? &quot;
third section is this idea of not knowing , of consciously putting yourself backwards .
again , that &apos;s one of the themes that i think has come through loud and clear in this conference is : where do we start ? how do we start ? what do we do to start ?
showing a series of inspiring , unusual and playful products , british branding and design guru paul bennett explains that design doesn &apos;t have to be about grand gestures , but can solve small , universal and overlooked problems .
that &apos;s them rolling .
it gets taken over by children .
our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
70 years ago , it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of &quot; we can . &quot;
and before the kind of collapse of the communist system , i was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in space city and other places in russia .
that would be the answer .
and quite interestingly , over something like a 60-year period , we &apos;re seeing the doubling in life expectancy , over that period where the urbanization has trebled .
it anticipated change , even though those changes were not known .
i mean , this is a glimpse of the interior of our hong kong bank of 1979 , which opened in 1985 , with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here .
a combination of biomass , aquifers , burning vegetable oil -- a process that , quite interestingly , was developed in eastern germany , at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc .
and the dead sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it .
and that &apos;s a concerted platform .
they created this shade that you can see here , which actually covers the sun , but opens up to the good light from the sky .
and you enter that space , and you feel like , &quot; wow ! this is so impressive , &quot; just because of this focal point , this huge light source in the middle .
so light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us .
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness .
can we be more gentle with light ?
in architecture , it works just the same .
is it that i write very well ?
or of indian councils of science research do not require that whatever you learn from people , you must share back with them .
we should be doing something about it .
and it all begins with curiosity .
if we can create markets for these artists , we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .
in the scaling up , there &apos;s an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people , point by point , with the supply that you &apos;re making .
ag : saidulluh sahib is in motihari , again in champaran .
and we have a very vibrant network in china , particularly , but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world .
he said , &quot; i can &apos;t . this is the only thing i know , but i &apos;ll invent a machine , which will solve your problem . &quot;
i would love to talk about the technology , and sometime , in what &apos;s past the 15 minutes , i &apos;ll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what &apos;s in here .
150 years ago , locomotives got efficient enough , steam power , that we turned the continent into a country .
and every one of those industries , by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry .
so we &apos;ve been working really , really hard , but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what &apos;s important , and how to apply the technology .
they didn &apos;t have to take the 100-year trip we took .
certainly , in the rest of the world , your choice is to devastate the place , turning everything that will burn into heat , or drink the water that &apos;s available .
and so , the day of the scheduled procession , thousands of people showed up .
and the only way to do this , because it &apos;s illegal , is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs .
the way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality , they let people know that they are there , and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say , &quot; i offer you to be the local representative of the zeta brand . &quot;
when they &apos;re entering a new market , they send or , if they &apos;re partnering with a new organization , they create a family tie , either through marriages or other types of ties .
and so we have to understand not only why tech &apos;s important , where it &apos;s going , but also , very importantly , when -- the timing is everything .
towards the end of their life , they become nearly free .
now they &apos;ve introduced these four ways of looking at technology , these four stages of technology &apos;s life .
interestingly , it &apos;s done a crossover before , but not the crossovers that matter .
it &apos;s an economic force ; it &apos;s a technical force .
because of some of technologies we &apos;ve been talking about .
patient capital works between , and tries to take the best of both .
the first one was miniaturization .
this idea of scale is critical .
on one of my last visits to pakistan , i asked dr. sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the thar desert .
the time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions , a cross sector , is now .
if you looked in the book , you saw this , which i really was appalled by .
i was an english major in college . i didn &apos;t have any use for it , but i missed writing . so , i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories .
how much money does he spend on beer in a year ?
one story is about this baby , and his name is odin .
but then you also find people &apos;s blogs , and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic , but things that interest them .
this is the only picture i have . and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ; to think about the people who are on those $ 100 computers talking about who they are , sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing .
and this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship , and flattening this sort of world .
it was fished sustainably till all of time , except for our generation .
and we &apos;ve got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works .
we &apos;d been studying these fish , but first we had to learn how to husbandry them .
now sometimes the tunas are really large , such as this fish off nantucket .
astronomically , we &apos;re calculating positions .
now right next door in monterey and up at the farallones are a white shark team led by scott anderson -- there -- and sal jorgensen .
so this is just three years of data right here -- and there &apos;s a decade of this data .
let &apos;s connect the public to this activity right on their iphone .
so i pulled out my little pda , and i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s look up my appointments for september 12th . &quot;
well the first one was , &quot; is your name hasan ? &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
then i &apos;d make websites .
this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch 99 in daly city on sunday , november 15th .
so how do you know these are meals eaten at home ?
and i understand that , on an individual level , it &apos;s purely symbolic .
hasan , just curious .
and so sebastian bought squeak to protect his reputation .
it &apos;s about empowering people to make meaningful connections , connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we &apos;ve lost somewhere along the way , by engaging in marketplaces like airbnb , like kickstarter , like etsy , that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions .
i actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through taskrabbit .
and it &apos;s not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering .
there are actually a wave of startups like connect.me and legit and trustcloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate , monitor and use your online reputation .
on stack overflow , it creates a level playing field , enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top .
a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
everything goes into it .
who put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society .
and as we like to say -- and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here -- if americans want to live the american dream , they should go to denmark .
this is just one example .
i should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data , we never pick and choose data .
richard wilkinson : how economic inequality harms societies
this is a low-end titanium knee .
but the reality is our users , our customers , they do different things . they sit cross-legged more .
and this goes into my last point .
he &apos;d spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars .
whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people &apos;s hair with toenail clippers , or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses .
it &apos;s just neat ; it &apos;s fun . it &apos;s so much fun i have it in my house -- but i have it in the entryway , i don &apos;t use it to make juice .
instead of saying , &quot; you got 73,000 results .
no problem .
that &apos;s what brainstorming is about , right ?
visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
on top of that , it communicates , which is what emotion does .
this is a clear don norman watch .
we made a guess . the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers .
and finally came the question of , how do you tackle teacher perception ?
so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it , this time in a city called shivpuri in the center of india , where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything .
i was real surprised .
and that may be of great , you know , interest to this group , because all of you are talking about groups .
the third piece was on values , and again , to put it very briefly , i conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over india , and asked them -- i gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions .
and such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness , values and violence .
i was fascinated by the cold war , by the inf negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles , the proxy war between the soviet union and the u.s .
i &apos;d already served in germany , norway , various other places , but i was posted to new york to serve on the u.n. security council for the british delegation .
one was that , in the summer of 2004 , the british government , somewhat reluctantly , decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war , a very limited subject .
a second thing happened in kosovo , which kind of delivered the answer , which i couldn &apos;t really answer , which is , &quot; what do i do with my life ? &quot;
it was a complicated thing , and i &apos;m not pretending it was more simple than it was .
and we started talking , and he said -- i told him what i was doing , and i told him rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york .
if governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world , then that means , who is left to deal with them , who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them ?
it &apos;ll be great . you can have an exchange .
carne ross : an independent diplomat
and they walk out from behind the counter and they &apos;ve got no pants on .
thank you .
we feel awe , we feel pity .
okay , here we go .
you have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows -- &quot; gunsmoke &quot; and &quot; gomer pyle &quot; -- in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
no , they want judgment .
but i &apos;m slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything .
here &apos;s what had to happen .
but i bet it was presented in a way that it didn &apos;t exactly stick in your mind .
you know , i keep talking about this idea of telling a story , and it &apos;s like science communication has taken on this idea of what i call the tyranny of precision , where you can &apos;t just tell a story .
i dream of a wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand .
we talk about being uplifted or elevated .
others use dancing , spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence .
we want to satisfy our individual desires .
well let me show you .
the main argument against group selection has always been that , well sure , it would be nice to have a group of cooperators , but as soon as you have a group of cooperators , they &apos;re just going to get taken over by free-riders , individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others .
and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .
the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected .
one great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top .
and i found that there was an historic precedence .
on the inside it &apos;s a recreation of a 16th century japanese tea house .
i actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal , and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work , unlike powerpoint and some other programs .
i would probably park in front of the other one .
so it tends to get discounted .
&quot; when new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies , anxieties of all kinds result . &quot;
they were wild-posted around new york city .
but anyway , this is one of the ads i was most pleased with , because they were all elaborately art-directed , and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer .
it &apos;s kind of horsey type , but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting : there was something more enticing , if that &apos;s the right -- it &apos;s not the right word -- but in this cover than time or newsweek .
i &apos;m just not sure this is improvement .
and when i was teaching , i used to always ask the students , what &apos;s the definition of a good job ?
danny hillis actually has an update on that -- he says technology is anything that doesn &apos;t quite work yet .
i can &apos;t think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism .
and the last thing , i bring back this nudibranch .
and so it would be sort of approximately up there , coming out of the animal kingdom . and if we were to do that , we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way .
it &apos;s not just that it was resurrected . it &apos;s continued all along .
that &apos;s what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms .
and so when i think about what technology wants , i think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and i really believe this -- every person here has an assignment . and your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is .
and i knew , right then , at age six , that is an animal that i want to learn more about . so i did .
yeah , i &apos;ll be a filmmaker . &quot;
and as soon as the crabs touched the arm , it was lights out .
and when you dive into that rift valley , that &apos;s where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range .
and there &apos;s a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed .
she said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world .
in theory , we &apos;re thinking , rational human beings .
we &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supposed to be in .
now when i was a little older , in my 20s , i realized there are not many women in cartooning .
that &apos;s where all these problems come from .
we use them metaphorically -- the dna of a company , the metabolism of a city , and so on -- is that just bullshit , metaphorical bullshit , or is there serious substance to it ?
this is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away , and everybody making millions and billions of dollars .
heart rates are slower ; you live longer ; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower , etc .
but most important in this , the exponent , the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate , is bigger than one -- it &apos;s about 1.15 to 1.2 .
economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior .
there &apos;s walmart . doesn &apos;t look very sigmoidal .
i could get access to it .
could teach them the more exciting topic of geography .
we deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test , and i am here to share with you : it is not learning .
it asked them to create for themselves , and it allowed them to fail , process , learn from .
regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
in 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree .
this is a newt re-growing its limb .
clearly , we heal ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work .
that material contained only natural signals .
he chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .
they &apos;ve decided that liposuction fluid , which -- in the united states , we have a lot of liposuction fluid .
the good news is that this is happening today .
i &apos;d like to close by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his appetite .
okay . okay . oh , well .
it &apos;s lovely to know they &apos;re concerned , you know .
even though , quite frankly , some of your presentations are horrifying , absolutely horrifying .
i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath .
so , i think all people , we need that , but especially , i look at people like me , you know like , i mean , latinos -- we &apos;re about to be the majority , in like two weeks .
well , i just wanted to quickly say good evening .
but that &apos;s where we had some problems .
so , even though sometimes it &apos;s still hard , i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant , usually because of places like this , because of ideas like this , and people like you , with an open mind .
and i pray that this is the way that we will self-invent , in time .
so it turned out there was a lot more in common than i would have dreamed .
so i set out in a hurry . i studied engineering .
and to put a face on it , people like muhammad yunus , who started the grameen bank , has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world , won the nobel peace prize .
and our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change .
and so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest , and today is mandatory viewing in schools in england and scotland , and most of scandinavia .
and i like this one , &quot; snow has returned to kilimanjaro . &quot;
and it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off , has an accident and needs a hospital .
anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag .
see , that &apos;s one of the problems we have in nigeria and in africa generally .
this is what i mean about appropriate technology .
so that &apos;s not new . what we &apos;re doing is applying this technology to it .
in that moment in time , mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid rainbow nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
sing campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
avelile &apos;s mother had hiv virus -- she died from aids-related illness .
big brother : we are one people with one will , one resolve , one cause .
as wael ghonim , the google-egyptian-executive by day , secret-facebook-activist by night , famously said to cnn after mubarak stepped down , &quot; if you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet . &quot;
but if you look at china , vietnam and a number of the former soviet states , what &apos;s happening there is more troubling .
and here in the united kingdom there &apos;s also concern over a law called the digital economy act that &apos;s placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an unprecedented expansion , now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world &apos;s gdp .
the court system wasn &apos;t functioning properly .
the zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed .
so i have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys .
now , even by the police &apos;s admission , this makes not a dent in the profits , really , of the major exporters .
it &apos;s really not that difficult .
this is a mighty industry , and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes .
they knew what happened .
nobody has questioned it .
you &apos;ve exposed us to public ridicule !
here you can &apos;t find anybody to compare it with , because we &apos;re the only animal that walks upright on two legs .
i am trying to suggest that , for 40-odd years , this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe , and it is not lunatic fringe .
anybody else out there ? come on in .
they decided in 1960 , &quot; that belongs with the ufos and the yetis . &quot;
and two -- i want to pick the theme for ted 2006 .
yeah , i was hanging out with some google guys last night .
four years later , i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures , you know ?
&quot; why ? &quot; and i say , &quot; mom , dad -- &quot; i &apos;m trying . &quot; you know , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re all aware of this , but the video -- the video game market , kids are playing these video games , oh , but , supposedly , there &apos;s tons of money .
so i try to -- -- i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves , and , hopefully -- whoa , i &apos;m like -- on the page , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
they actually get to know each other , and it &apos;s sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we &apos;re lacking . and very , very quickly -- i love puppets . here &apos;s a puppet .
well , chances are i &apos;ve got a droid who &apos;s picking up the phone , &quot; yes , they called , and they said they didn &apos;t like it . &quot;
ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere .
politicians are strange creatures , says politician omar ahmad . and the best way to engage them on your pet issue is a monthly handwritten letter . ahmad shows why old-fashioned correspondence is more effective than email , phone or even writing a check -- and shares the four simple steps to writing a letter that works .
it &apos;s fairly self-explanatory .
and so i would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that i could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me .
and once again , it &apos;s this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
levin writes that all over the world , nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable , dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era .
so i &apos;m a social psychologist , and i study morality , and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds .
but it is a gross distortion of reality .
republicans like republicans . that &apos;s not a surprise .
so there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this .
especially , it destroys our ability to trust each other , to feel that we &apos;re all in the same boat , because it &apos;s obvious we &apos;re not .
so once again , we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing .
the southern poverty law center is often fighting the prison-industrial complex , fighting to prevent a system that &apos;s just sucking in more and more poor young men .
i &apos;m working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture , and we &apos;re collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach .
if you walk around the city of oxford , where we are today , and have a look at the brickwork , which i &apos;ve enjoyed doing in the last couple of days , you &apos;ll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone .
we &apos;ve observed this in the laboratory .
in fact , i &apos;ve managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades , perhaps my proudest accomplishment .
instead , i &apos;m a chaired professor of law , psychology and psychiatry at the usc gould school of law , i have many close friends and i have a beloved husband , will , who &apos;s here with us today .
quoting from my writings : &quot; my two classmates , rebel and val , and i had made the date to meet in the law school library on friday night to work on our memo assignment together .
then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps .
i &apos;ve never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view .
i could get you admitted right away , and the whole thing could be very discrete . &apos; &apos; ha , ha , ha .
it &apos;s a national tragedy and scandal that the l.a. county jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the united states .
i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges where the u.s. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert .
do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn &apos;t rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes , and do away with all traffic jams on highways ?
it supports wild fish including cutthroat , brown and rainbow trout .
they &apos;re concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they &apos;re trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they &apos;re concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand .
this individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion , leaving the water in the stream .
i am kind of a pop culture nerd , and i think a lot about what makes a strong female character , and , you know , movies and tv shows , these things have influence . my own website .
if you use that , you can get away with anything .
compassion is fun .
another example , three googlers -- a chef , an engineer and , most funny , a massage therapist -- three of them , they learned about a region in india where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility .
and he calls them &quot; level 5 leaders . &quot;
the second ingredient is autonomy .
what does that mean ? imagine this .
it is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time .
or is it other countries ?
but i said to them , &quot; i just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot;
now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot;
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you &apos;re reading , there &apos;s something really soothing and easy .
i &apos;m italian . in italy , design is normal .
so , i started out in &apos; 95 with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design .
so , safe is the last exhibition that i did at moma and it ended at the beginning of last year .
i want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very , very clear limits .
similarly , there &apos;s the work of people like marti guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste , orally .
and it &apos;s the story of many of the africans who are here .
let &apos;s go and try and talk to the headmistress .
you know , so money ran out .
i was actually crying during his presentation .
you know , it &apos;s not enough to complain . we need to act .
my partner , m , who &apos;s a tech guru , hacked wordpress .
i &apos;ve had lots of conversations about things i think need to be happening in africa .
and he tried to talk me out of it , but it was like , &quot; ok , i know nothing about applying to law school , i &apos;m poli-sci ph.d .
and as africans , we need to take responsibility for our continent .
so we had to start from scratch .
last november 2012 , over 33,000 runners from 85 different nationalities came to the start line , but this time , they challenged very stormy and rainy weather .
they &apos;re two big words , i don &apos;t know what they mean .
take a blood sample and run it through a machine called a coulter counter .
so this is a machine called the touchb quik .
the questions and conversations that followed were fascinating .
rule number two : embrace the mess .
ramsey musallam : 3 rules to spark learning
you might find this strange , but in my family we have different accents .
cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water .
and there &apos;s predictions that we &apos;ll be nine billion by 2050 .
and so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need .
now , the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face , and then on the top of it you add , &quot; and thousands of the young people from athens , madrid and new york will demonstrate for social justice , claiming that they are inspired with arabs . &quot;
they will say , &quot; people power will work if the annual income of the country is between x and z. &quot;
there are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow .
well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
same works for the western sector , where you can see all of these excited young people protesting around the world , occupying this , occupying that .
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk live-streamed .
i said , &quot; if 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
so let me go on the record and say , vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation , creativity and change .
so when i became vulnerability ted , like an action figure -- like ninja barbie , but i &apos;m vulnerability ted -- i thought , i &apos;m going to leave that shame stuff behind , because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability .
i saw the ted fellows my first day here .
that &apos;s what life is about , about daring greatly , about being in the arena .
and here &apos;s what you even need to know more .
and he said , &quot; that &apos;s convenient . &quot;
and i know it &apos;s seductive to stand outside the arena , because i think i did it my whole life , and think to myself , i &apos;m going to go in there and kick some ass when i &apos;m bulletproof and when i &apos;m perfect .
thank you .
good morning .
dr. v : i used to sit with the ordinary village man because i am from a village , and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being , you seem to be one with him .
so they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery , are counseled , and then there are buses waiting , which will transport them to the base hospital .
so , putting all this together , what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else .
so we &apos;re really comparing apples to apples .
so the question is : how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ?
if you change the grasp , it can adjust to that .
fabian hemmert : the shape-shifting future of the mobile phone
so when i began to dive , in 2005 , i realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does , but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure , completely different to people &apos;s responses to the wheelchair .
it &apos;s still working its way up the food chain .
but climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution , but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our gdp .
the flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted , chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides .
the earth always did have limits .
you can &apos;t just drill a hole and pump it out .
the idea behind this form of &quot; geoengineering &quot; as it &apos;s called , is that , as the planet heats up , we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun &apos;s rays back to space , thereby cooling the planet .
dh : now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it &apos;s something we just kind of learned for this , so we &apos;re going to try . but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ?
i &apos;m now pushing my luck : i &apos;m skipping right to six cups .
richard wurman : can i say something ?
rw : do you want me to hold you or not ? dh : don &apos;t hold me that hard .
bf : incredible , you say ?
bf : yeah , a little sketchy .
wow , wow , ok , stop .
bf : yeah , it &apos;s a good setup . that &apos;s a big setup .
dh : i do , i do .
now , i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture .
completely mechanical . this whole machine is mechanical .
now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along .
it doesn &apos;t matter if your computer &apos;s mechanical , like babbage &apos;s was , or electronic , like computers are today , or perhaps in the future , cells , or , again , mechanical again , once we get into nanotechnology .
so , give me five years .
north pole . i &apos;ve done this picture last summer .
according to the u.n. , we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050 .
12th if i was to go back to iraq and speak to the people , i &apos;d have to bow down and kiss their feet .
how can we make it all by ourselves ?
half of the world &apos;s forests have vanished .
we have all a part of the solutions .
and then we bring that into software , and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is .
she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later .
and it turns out nick shows up at the children &apos;s hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim .
not to worry though , that was quickly rescued by the ipod , facebook and , indeed , angry birds .
so my father &apos;s father was one of 10 resnick brothers .
we &apos;re sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia .
and eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies .
coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal .
the mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales .
all of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties , and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .
the electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge , which make this pattern .
when we include these , each matter particle has two different spin charges , spin-up and spin-down .
however , if we work in eight-dimensional charge space , then we can assign unique new charges to each particle .
of course , when other physicists and i actually work on this stuff , the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth .
now it &apos;s one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how i managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment .
i kind of feel like i need that for my picture .
but what about how they behaved ? that &apos;s what he wanted to know .
and these really aggressive behaviors , for the most part , are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group .
empowering women , working with education , providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school , in the clear understanding that , all around the world , as women &apos;s education improves , family size drops .
as i began traveling around africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests , i realized more and more how so many of africa &apos;s problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation .
and these young people , when i talk to them , basically they were either depressed or apathetic , or bitter and angry . and they said more or less the same thing , &quot; we feel this way because we feel you &apos;ve compromised our future and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot;
they &apos;re working in the refugee camps , with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money , or just using them to feed their families , and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment , because they &apos;re no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens .
what we buy . what we wear .
and just a last word on that -- the young woman who &apos;s running this entire conference center , i met her today .
and the bigger picture is : we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .
and i know that i am doing a service to myself and my family .
but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors .
as you interact with someone at ted , maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags , the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages .
when i saw aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and i thought , &quot; what a brave woman .
my son , i don &apos;t know where he is .
now what i learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had .
i talked a lot in the past about statistics , and the provision of safe drinking water for all .
the smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers .
so we &apos;re just going to put that in there as well .
pop the cartridge out . pop a new one in .
and how much does it cost ?
and of course , into the vacuum where the too-old european powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part : the two great world wars .
now notice , i &apos;m not talking about government .
we are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus .
my guess is iraq and afghanistan are the last times when the west has tried to do it themselves , and we haven &apos;t succeeded .
today in our modern world , because of the internet , because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here , everything is connected to everything .
ashdown &apos;s third law is that in the modern age , where everything is connected to everything , the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others .
paddy ashdown : the global power shift
your chances are very low .
that &apos;s why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person .
here in sardinia , the older you get the more equity you have , the more wisdom you &apos;re celebrated for .
they also have a 3,000-year-old adage , which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented .
and this is a question . the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians .
this is a heterogeneous community .
marge is 104 .
they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook .
exercise programs usually start in january ; they &apos;re usually done by october .
we may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us , but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature , keyboards that roll up , and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch .
and now that he published this work , others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements .
so what happens ?
occasionally we sense something wrong or too late .
so how do we get there ?
i think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data .
you do it again and again .
and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero-g .
if you look at the math , e = mc squared , if you look at the cosmological constant , where there &apos;s an anthropic ideal , where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand .
they cause different things to happen inside the cell .
one : that society equates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person .
i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .
so i went in the bookstore . and i found tim &apos;s book .
becky blanton planned to live in her van for a year and see the country , but when depression set in and her freelance job ended , her camping trip turned into homelessness . in this intimate talk , she describes her experience of becoming one of america &apos;s working homeless .
and no difference , the people they chose were the people we chose .
again , education , class entertainment .
obviously , he &apos;s had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten , and he was very happy .
he became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget fifty-fold .
imagine if they had condoms , giving out to all sorts of people .
there was political commitment , some financial commitment , and everybody joined in the fight .
now we &apos;re making scottish tartans , as you can see on the left , to sell to all people of scottish ancestors .
thailand &apos;s &quot; mr. condom , &quot; mechai viravaidya , walks us through the country &apos;s bold plan to raise its standard of living , starting in the 1970s . first step : population control . and that means a lot of frank , funny -- and very effective -- talk about condoms . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now this is a free app on the app store , so if any of you guys had this app on your phones , we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together .
so those are a couple of the really cool things that romo can do today .
what is truer than truth ? answer : the story .
only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal .
i don &apos;t know .
two tiny little boys .
feminism is not dead , by no means .
the day before , her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him .
we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody , not only for the privileged .
let &apos;s get off our fannies , roll up our sleeves and get to work , passionately , in creating an almost perfect world .
so if you &apos;ve ever taken a game theory course at any level , you will have learned a little bit about this .
and you see activity in some regions we &apos;ve seen today , medial prefrontal cortex , dorsomedial , however , up here , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , an area that &apos;s involved in lots of types of conflict resolution , like if you &apos;re playing &quot; simon says , &quot; and also the right and left temporoparietal junction .
but we &apos;re interested in , can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don &apos;t occur ?
they &apos;re still our closest genetic kin .
his thought was , maybe they &apos;ve preserved brain activities and they practice them in development to negotiate status and to win , which is something like strategic thinking during competition .
how do you feed a city ?
and to end all of this , at the end of this long process , we &apos;re not even managing to feed the planet properly .
this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world , because it was very difficult to transport food over roads , which were rough .
friday street , in a previous life , is where you went to buy your fish on a friday .
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto .
carolyn steel : how food shapes our cities
this is the source of all morality , this imaginative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another .
i &apos;d like youth to get a sense of the dynamism , the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle .
today i &apos;d like to show you the future of the way we make things .
so these are the brilliant scientists , engineers , designers that worked on this project .
so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one .
recently i visited beloit , wisconsin .
it was a little over 100 years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses .
i &apos;m pleased to announce that , along with colleagues at stanford and caltech and ucsf , we &apos;re currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life .
and they are . so let me start with the second one : typical . well -- is this a typical place ? well , let &apos;s look around , you know , and look in a random direction , and we see a wall , and chemical scum -- -- and that &apos;s not typical of the universe at all .
well , what does that mean ? well , look out even further than we &apos;ve just been -- i mean from here , with a telescope -- and you &apos;ll see things that look like stars .
our location is saturated with evidence , and also with matter and energy .
i think he &apos;s going to talk about that later in the conference .
and with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival .
that &apos;s the kind of rules that the cellphone company that nelson purchases his telephony from operates under .
